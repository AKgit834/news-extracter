{"data": ["A string of Diddy-Justin Bieber videos have emerged on social media, each going viral for unsettling reasons as fans allege the disgraced Hip-Hop mogul of possibly subjecting the younger artist to grooming and other disturbing experiences. Yet another clip surfaced online earlier today, featuring Bieber coming in to check on Diddy.The said video was reportedly posted three years ago, but the timing of its online revival has got fans correlating it with Homeland Security raiding Diddy's Los Angeles and Miami mansions in the last days of March. The American rapper and former chairman of Revolt TV has been embroiled in sexual assault, trafficking and more such allegations. His homes were raided after Rodney \u2018Lil Rod\u2019 Jones filed a $30M lawsuit against him. Since then, more contentious connections and videos from the past, targeting his former credibility, have re-materialised on internet platforms.The viral clip in question today is merely one of three videos demonstrating Diddy's (54) \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cdisturbing\u201d approach towards Justin (30).Bieber comes in to meet Diddy in his car, with a coffee cup in one hand. As they get talking, they hug and amicably dive into a short conversation that is barely caught on camera.Also read | Kanye West reportedly threatened to \u2018shave' children's heads and lock them in \u2018jails\u2019: LawsuitAs the camera turns around with Diddy's back to it and all focus on Bieber, the older musician seems to be asking Justin something. To which, the Never Say Never hitmaker nods a \u2018no\u2019. The video then pictures Diddy patting down Bieber's chest several times. Eventually, his hand ends on the 30-year-old singer's chest as he seemingly pulls him into an embrace.In what appears to be another hug before they bid adieu, the two hold their stances for a moment, as Diddy presumably whispers something into Bieber's ear. Breaking out of the hug, they both part ways, and Bieber utters a final \u201cLove you\u201d before boarding his car again.The question answers itself. Bieber and Diddy joined forces in 2023 for the latter's track Moments on The Love Album: Off The Grid. Yet, even before meeting up in the studio for this 2023 song, numerous \u2018old\u2019 videos capture their awkward exchanges. In one of them, Diddy hounds a younger Justin, possibly around 16, about keeping his distance from him.As they stand in a recording studio, the \u201ccreepy\u201d video \u2013 as fans have labelled it, shows Diddy saying, \u201cSelling out arenas and everything? Starting to act different, huh? You haven\u2019t been calling me and hanging out the way we used to hang out.\u201dIn his response, Bieber is clearly pictured stuttering. He finally lets out, \u201cI mean, you tried to get in contact with me throughout all my [projects] and whatnot \u2014 but you never got my number.\u201dAlso read | Nicki Minaj's real-life Barbie moments on Pink Friday 2 tour keep serving consecutive sold-out thrillsThis was around the time Usher was closely mentoring Bieber. He, in turn, was previously under the \u201clegal guardianship\u201d of Diddy, as Combs mentioned in another unsettling clip while talking to a 15-year-old Bieber. \u201cHe's having 48 hours with Diddy. We can't really disclose where we're hanging out or what we're doing, but it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream,\u201d Puff Daddy claims. Read more about it here.Either way, all these videos are garnering similar responses from netizens and Bieber fans alike. \u201cIf this is what they were doing to Justin Bieber on TV I can't imagine what he had to endure behind the scenes,\u201d wrote an X (formerly Twitter) user.Another one pointed out: \u201cAll adults have cruelly used and hurt Justin's innocent, hopeful heart and bright future.\u201d A third echoed the sentiment, \u201cAll these clips of justin beiber and p diddy make me so sad. people were so hard on him when he was struggling. in reality he was exposed to things he shouldn\u2019t have at you age by other musicians who didnt care how young he was.\u201dThe internet also pondered why and how these videos were breaking out from the past out of the blue. A common question raised by many probed into why these dots weren't connected in the past itself.\u201cAll these videos that are coming out now, why did no one ever connect the dots about this guy? The weird comments he made, the strange physical contact, people dropping obvious hints about his parties.. It\u2019s crazy what being rich and famous allows you get away with,\u201d highlighted a netizen.And another questioned, \u201cAfter he ensures, bieber isn\u2019t wearing a wire, he says something to Bieber & then Bieber nods in affirmation. How deep this rabbit hole goes?\u201d"]}
