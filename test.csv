1,"NEW DELHI: A video, purportedly recorded by the assailants of the devastating incident at a Moscow entertainment venue, has surfaced on online platforms frequently utilized by the extremist faction Islamic State (IS), as reported by the SITE Intelligence Group.This video, spanning ninety seconds, captures unidentified gunmen equipped with assault rifles and blades, their faces obscured and voices distorted.The scene is set in what seems to be the entrance hall of the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert location situated in Krasnogorsk, on the outskirts of Moscow.Throughout the footage, the perpetrators unleash multiple rounds of gunfire, leaving several lifeless bodies scattered across the area, with flames visibly igniting in the surroundings.The footage was disseminated through a Telegram channel that the SITE monitoring service identifies as associated with Amaq, the communication division of IS.IS took responsibility for this brutal onslaught late Friday, resulting in the tragic demise of no fewer than 133 individuals, marking this incident as the most lethal assault attributed to the jihadist entity on European territory.Crocus Concert Hall Terror Attack in Moscow: All you want to knowIsis-K or Isis-C?Isis has been trying to carry out attacks on both US and Russian targets since its formation. Russia has been in Isis crosshairs for long. In the past, Isis has taken responsibility for various assaults in Russia’s tumultuous Caucasus region and other areas in recent years. It has enlisted combatants from Russia and other regions of the former Soviet Union.But which Isis affiliate Isis-K or Isis-C carried out the Moscow massacre? Security analysts suggest that the lethal assault on Moscow’s Crocus City concert hall might have involved collaboration between multiple branches of Isis, based on available circumstantial evidence, a report in South China Morning Post said.Michael Kugelman from the Wilson Center emphasized Isis's long-standing focus on Russia due to historical grievances and ongoing Russian military actions against Isis in Syria and Africa's Sahel region.Moscow terrorist attack: US Warned its citizens about possible attack a month ago. Here are the detailsIsis has a notorious history of orchestrating mass shootings in crowded venues, a strategy initially adopted by Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists during the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The recent Moscow incident, which Isis has yet to formally attribute to a specific branch within its network, suggests the involvement of its southern Russia and Afghanistan branches, known as Isis-Caucasia (Isis-C) and Isis-Khorasan (Isis-K), respectively, the SCMP report said.Isis-Caucasia, commonly abbreviated as Isis-C, represents a regional offshoot of the broader Islamic State organization, specifically targeted towards the Caucasus region in southern Russia. This area includes significant locales like Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, and other North Caucasian republics, known for their historical, ethnic, and religious complexities.The group’s Afghanistan affiliate is known variously as Isis-K or IS-K, taking its name from Khorasan Province, a region that covered much of Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia in the Middle Ages.Russia Terrorist attack: Moscow united to pray for the victims as death toll rises to 133The affiliate has thousands of fighters who have repeatedly carried out attacks in Afghanistan since the country was seized in 2021 by the Taliban, a group with which they are at bitter odds.The strategies used by the assailants in Moscow, along with a prior alert from the US indicating an imminent Isis-planned terrorist attack aimed at a significant public event in Moscow, serve as evidence suggesting this was an operation by Isis, according to Abdul Basit, a senior research associate at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.Basit noted, “speculatively, the experts are saying” Isis-C is the “main perpetrator” but it received “some help” from Isis-K, the SCMP report said.As per US intel, Isis is much depleted now but its regional offshoots are expected to ""continue to expand"" and looming threat is most likely to emerge from ""small cells or individuals"".(With inputs from agencies)US Hiding ‘Ukrainian Involvement’: Russia Slams White House Statement on Moscow Terror Attack"
2,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that ""a terrorist is a terrorist"" regardless of language or explanation, and terrorism should never be justified or defended based on linguistic or cultural differences.Jaishankar's remarks came during his interaction with the Indian community members in Singapore.Jaishankar highlighted the importance of diplomacy in reconciling differing viewpoints on sensitive issues such as terrorism, underscoring the need to distinguish genuine differences from excuses or justifications.""It's also natural that there will be different viewpoints. And what diplomacy is about is to find a way of reconciling it and coming to some kind of agreement,"" he said.""You can take it in any language, but a terrorist is a terrorist in any language. Never allow something like terrorism to be excused or defended because they're using a different language or a different explanation,"" he added.Underlining India's commitment to global service, Jaishankar mentioned India's active role in combating piracy in the Indian Ocean and responding to crises, showcasing India's responsible and proactive stance on global issues. The external affairs minister also highlighted India's accelerated infrastructure development and its role as a global friend. “This is India which will not be pressured, which will state its mind. If it has to make a choice, we will make a choice for the welfare of our citizens … So, the idea is of much stronger, more capable India and willing to take the tough course,” he said.Jaishankar assured that this is an India which looks after its citizens and people of Indian origins.“As more and more Indians settle in different parts of the world, it is our responsibility to secure them, to ensure their wellbeing if they are in a difficult stage, to bring them home,” he said."
3,"Warren Buffett, the esteemed CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is not only known for his remarkable wealth, estimated at $136 billion, but also for his simple living standards and significant philanthropic efforts. Despite being one of the world's richest individuals, Buffett maintains a lifestyle that contradicts his immense wealth.As per an Inside report, Buffett continues to reside in the same Omaha home he purchased in the 1950s and drives vehicles that are far from luxurious.His breakfast often comes from McDonald's, and he is known to have used borrowed furniture when his children were young. His hobbies include playing bridge, golfing, and strumming on one of his 22 ukuleles, a skill he used to charm his first wife, Susan.The bulk of Buffett's wealth is tied to Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that has amassed over $1 trillion in assets. His journey to riches began at an early age, investing in stocks at 11 and filing taxes by 13. Despite his fortune, the majority of his wealth was accumulated after his 50th birthday, with his annual salary from Berkshire Hathaway remaining at $100,000 for the last 40 years, the Insider report said.Although Buffett has had his share of investment missteps, such as a Sinclair gas station, these have been vastly outweighed by his successes. Known for his frugality, Buffett has made limited splurges over the years, such as on a private jet, which he humorously dubbed ""The Indefensible.""His personal life has been marked by two marriages and three children. Buffett’s philanthropy is renowned; he pledged to donate 85% of his Berkshire Hathaway shares to five foundations, leading a global initiative with Bill and Melinda Gates called The Giving Pledge, which encourages the world's wealthiest to commit a significant portion of their wealth to charitable causes.Despite his vast wealth, Buffett emphasizes the importance of living a fulfilling life without excessive materialism. He once expressed at a shareholder meeting, ""There are things money can't buy... My life couldn't be happier. In fact, it'd be worse if I had six or eight houses. So, I have everything I need to have, and I don't need any more because it doesn't make a difference after a point."""

The video features the women applying colors to each other's cheeks with a Hindi film song playing in the background. In a statement, DMRC said that it is investigating the authenticity of the video. ""On first impression, the authenticity of the video shot inside the metro also appears doubtful,"" the DMRC said in a statement, raising the possibility of deepfake technology being used. In the video, the girls, wearing traditional clothes are seen putting colours on each other in an intimate manner. Popular Bollywood song 'Ang Laga De' is playing in the background. DMRC is also examining the video for a potential violation of its policies.The DMRC emphasized its efforts to discourage such activities within its network. ""Through numerous campaigns and commuter awareness drives, we have tried to educate passengers about refraining from making reels or engaging in any activity that inconveniences fellow commuters,"" the statement said.The DMRC urged passengers to report any such filming immediately. ""We also request fellow passengers to inform us immediately if they see such shoots being conducted,"" it added."
5,"NEW DELHI: The fans appeared to have given Hardik Pandya a cold shoulder as he made his Mumbai Indians captaincy debut against Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.The new MI skipper Pandya was booed by the fans when he came out for the toss while chants of 'Rohit Rohit' (former captain Rohit Sharma) reverberated throughout the entire stadium.During the toss, when Ravi Shastri introduced the captains, Pandya was met with boos from the fans.Even after winning the toss, they continued to jeer at him when he began to speak.Former England player and commentator Kevin Pietersen expressed his astonishment upon witnessing the crowd's reaction, stating that he has never seen an Indian player receive such treatment before.""I have never seen any Indian player getting booed like they are booing Hardik Pandya here in Ahmedabad. This is a rare happening,"" Pietersen said on air.Pietersen also raised doubts about Pandya's decision to bowl the first over himself instead of opting for Jasprit Bumrah.Why is Jasprit Bumrah not opening the bowling? I don't understand this"". Fellow commentator Sunil Gavaskar endorsed his view: ""Very good question. Very, very good question.""Meanwhile, Pandya credited his birth place Gujarat for his success but made it clear that cricketing birth took place in Mumbai.""Feels good to be back. My birthplace is Gujarat, a lot of success came in Gujarat, very grateful to the crowd and this state. My cricketing birth happened in Mumbai, so really good to be back,"" Pandya said at the toss."

This festival is dedicated to the fusion of colours that seamlessly integrates art, beauty, and vibrancy into our lives. Among all the festivals, the festival of colours holds a special place in everyoneâs heart.The scene of Indiaâs playful Holi in every city is captivating. The splash of colours on those white t-shirts, the streets painted with colours, and the colourful clouds up in the sky cast a colourful twist to the festivities of this vibrant festival. A colourful cultural tradition, Holi is an emotion that teaches us playfulness.At its heart, Holi celebrates spring, the festival of love and colours. The festival has vivid shades, unifying communities in its auspicious celebrations. Also known by other names such as âDol Jatraâ, âDulhandiâ, 'Dol Purnima', and 'Rang Panchami', Holi is celebrated all over India according to different traditions and rituals. The moments of fun, gaiety, and celebrations cannot be experienced to the fullest in any festival more than the festival of colours-âHoliâ. The festival also symbolizes the victory of good over evil. The story of Prahaladâs faith and devotion to Lord Vishnu which saved him from being burnt by fire gives the valuable life lesson to trust the universe and to have faith in prayers. Holi also carries the beautiful message of love and bonding. In a mischievous way, Once Krishna playfully applied colours on the face of Radha Rani as she was fair-skinned. Since then, Holi is also celebrated as a festival of love all over India.Image credits: istockThe festival is enjoyed popularly by distributing gujiya, bhang, thandai, and mathri. People greet each other with âgulaalâand a popular phrase âBura na maano Holi haiâ. The pichkari is the most lovable part of Holi celebrations that drenches everyone in the spectrum of colours. On the occasion of Holi, looking at the platter of colours stirs up the excitement to colour the sweet faces of our loved ones. Well, Holi is not just a festival, it is a celebration of universal themesâlove, relationships, togetherness, beauty, and creativity.Beyond the celebrations of Holi, lies a conscious initiative to protect the environment. An Earth-friendly celebration of Holi promotes using natural colours to safeguard the ecosystem. A mindset shift towards organic Holi and water-free Holi is much needed for the conservation of natural resources and the execution of sustainable practices. The use of synthetic colours, plastic balloons, and water destroys the ecosystem. And so, this Holi, let us promise ourselves an eco-friendly Holi celebration.The festival has finally made its presence and the celebrations of Holi are a testament to Indiaâs rich cultural landscape.

Holi also carries the beautiful message of love and bonding. In a mischievous way, Once Krishna playfully applied colours on the face of Radha Rani as she was fair-skinned. Since then, Holi is also celebrated as a festival of love all over India.Image credits: istockThe festival is enjoyed popularly by distributing gujiya, bhang, thandai, and mathri. People greet each other with âgulaalâand a popular phrase âBura na maano Holi haiâ. The pichkari is the most lovable part of Holi celebrations that drenches everyone in the spectrum of colours. On the occasion of Holi, looking at the platter of colours stirs up the excitement to colour the sweet faces of our loved ones. Well, Holi is not just a festival, it is a celebration of universal themesâlove, relationships, togetherness, beauty, and creativity.Beyond the celebrations of Holi, lies a conscious initiative to protect the environment. An Earth-friendly celebration of Holi promotes using natural colours to safeguard the ecosystem. A mindset shift towards organic Holi and water-free Holi is much needed for the conservation of natural resources and the execution of sustainable practices. The use of synthetic colours, plastic balloons, and water destroys the ecosystem. And so, this Holi, let us promise ourselves an eco-friendly Holi celebration.The festival has finally made its presence and the celebrations of Holi are a testament to Indiaâs rich cultural landscape. From the excitement of its preparations to playing Holi, the new beginnings are all set to knock on the doors of our lives.

The cultural spectacle of Holi is the much-anticipated celebration to be held on 25th March this year. Tomorrow-25th March, the day will be completely immersed in the glory of colours. The excitement of the celebrations of this lively festival has sparked joy and happiness, unifying communities and people together in its spirit.The colourful Holi mela is held in many cities, towns, and villages and encapsulates the commencement of the auspicious festivities of Holi. The festival is more than a celebration, it is a testament to the rich Indian cultural vista illustrating a beautiful fusion of spirituality, modernity, and tradition. As people play Holi, the rainbow of colours up in the sky beautifies the ambiance with its colourful charm. A craze for a âHoli partyâ can be seen in children and adults as the festival is approaching. An excitement to drench each other with colours and throw water-filled balloons echoes the colourful spectacle of the festival.

Celebrating 'Phoolwali Holi', devotees of Lord Krishna offer rose petals and 'gulal' to the idol of Lord Krishna at the temples of Lord Krishna. Braj ki Holi is one of the biggest and lively events of Holi attracting millions of tourists and devotees to live through the vivid shades of Indiaâs cultural celebrations and practices. Rooted in the traditions of Hinduism, Holi symbolizes the end of winter and the onset of the summer season. It is celebrated on a grand scale in different parts of India. Also, Holi is known by several other different names such as âDhulhandi' in Rajasthan, 'Dol Jatra' or 'Dol Purnima' in West Bengal and Odisha, 'Lathmar Holi' or 'Braj ki Holi' in Uttar Pradesh (Braj Bhoomi), 'Rang Panchami' in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. After Holika Dahan -- the tradition of lighting a bonfire, a âChoti Holiâ is celebrated. People apply âgulalâ to each other and distribute the roasted grains offered to the bonfire. The preparations of âRangwali Holiâ, include buying pichkaris (water guns), gujiya, sweets, and colours.âBura na maano Holi haiâ is a popular saying that reflects Holi greetings.

27,"In the northern reaches of Brazil lies the island of Marajó, an ecological treasure where the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean. This island, roughly the size of Switzerland, is home to a unique policing method that has captured the world's attention. Here, the military police patrol the streets and fields not on horseback or in vehicles, but atop Asian water buffaloes.The Asian water buffalo, an animal endemic to India and Southeast Asia, has found an unlikely home on Marajó. Their journey to this Brazilian island is shrouded in mystery, with some believing they arrived from a shipwreck off the coast, while others claim they were brought over by prisoners escaping from French Guiana. Regardless of their origins, these buffaloes have thrived in Marajó's tropical climate, now numbering around half a million, surpassing the human population of 440,000.These buffaloes are not merely a novelty; they are deeply integrated into the local culture and economy. They serve as work animals, dragging carriages through the streets of Soure, assisting farmers in the fields, and even participating in local festivals featuring buffalo races. Their presence is also felt in the culinary scene, with buffalo steaks and mozzarella gracing restaurant menus.But perhaps the most striking role these creatures play is in law enforcement. The ""Buffalo Soldiers"" of Marajó, a term that nods to the 19th-century US army regiments and popularized by Bob Marley's reggae classic, are a unit of military police who ride buffaloes equipped with specially-adapted seats. This practice began out of necessity three decades ago when the flooded fields of Marajó made conventional patrolling methods impractical.The buffaloes' ability to navigate the muddy mangroves and flooded terrain during the rainy season gives them an advantage over horses and vehicles. They can reach speeds that other modes of transport cannot match in these conditions. However, mastering the control of a buffalo is a challenging task, requiring officers to undergo extensive training.The Buffaloes make navigating flooded terrain much easier for the police as compared to horses or vehicles Source: Getty ImagesThe sight of armed officers patrolling on buffalo back is not just a functional aspect of policing on Marajó; it has become a symbol of the island's identity and a tourist attraction. The headquarters of the Soure military police unit is adorned with a plaque made of bullet casings depicting a muscular buffalo holding a shotgun, further cementing the buffalo's iconic status on the island.As the world looks towards sustainable and eco-friendly practices, Marajó's buffalo patrols stand out as an example of how traditional methods can be adapted to modern needs. They highlight the importance of understanding local ecosystems and leveraging them in ways that benefit both the community and the natural world.The buffaloes of Marajó, once strangers to these lands, have become an integral part of the island's identity. They carry on their backs not just the officers tasked with protecting the community but also the legacy of a place where nature and culture intertwine in the most unexpected ways. In Marajó, the buffalo is more than an animal; it is a symbol of strength, cooperation, and a unique way of life that continues to fascinate and inspire.Six Palestinians killed in Nur Shams camp amid Ramadan"

Some users expressed sadness at the sight, with one comment simply stating, ""tbh just a very sad thing."" Others reminisced about simpler times, with one user nostalgically reflecting, ""10 years back you would see me carrying an iPad.""Several users questioned the practicality of the individual's actions, with one asking, ""Things people do with company laptops?""

30,"Holi, the festival of colours, is a joyous occasion celebrated by millions across the globe. However, amidst all the vibrant hues and festivities, it's essential to ensure the safety and well-being of our furry companions. As pet owners, it's our responsibility to celebrate Holi in a manner that keeps our pets safe from harm. In this article, we'll explore how you can enjoy a pet-friendly Holi while safeguarding your beloved animals from toxic colours and other potential hazards. Let us also look at basic suggestions and guidelines given by the Animal Welfare Board of India for Animal safety.Tips to ensure pet safety during Holi:1. Opt for pet-safe coloursWhen planning your Holi celebrations, make sure to choose pet-friendly colours that are non-toxic and safe for animals. Avoid using traditional synthetic colours that contain harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be extremely harmful if ingested by your pets. Instead, opt for natural and organic colours made from ingredients such as turmeric, beetroot, and spinach, which are not only safe but also eco-friendly.Additionally, you can create DIY pet-safe colours at home using ingredients readily available in your kitchen. For example, turmeric mixed with flour can create a vibrant yellow colour, while beetroot juice diluted with water can produce a lovely shade of pink. Get creative and experiment with different natural ingredients to make colourful powders and water-based paints that are safe for your pets to play with.2. Keep your pets indoorsOn the day of Holi, it's advisable to keep your pets indoors to protect them from the chaos and commotion associated with the festivities. Loud noises, crowded streets, and unfamiliar faces can cause stress and anxiety in animals, leading to undesirable behaviour or even accidents. Create a safe and comfortable space for your pets inside your home, away from the hustle and bustle of the celebrations, where they can feel secure and relaxed.If you have outdoor pets such as dogs or cats, consider bringing them indoors a day before and after Holi to minimize their exposure to coloured powders and water. Provide them with plenty of food, water, and toys to keep them entertained while they wait out the festivities indoors. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your pet's well-being.3. Protect your pet's eyes and skinIf you decide to include your pets in the Holi celebrations, take extra precautions to shield their eyes and skin from coloured powders and water. Consider dressing your pets in lightweight clothing or applying a coat of pet-safe sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful UV rays and colour stains. Additionally, use protective eyewear or pet goggles to prevent coloured powder from getting into their eyes, which can cause irritation or infection.Keep a close eye on your pets during the celebrations and intervene immediately if you notice any signs of discomfort or distress. Provide them with plenty of fresh water to drink and a shady spot to rest if they become overheated or tired. Remember, your pets rely on you to keep them safe, so be vigilant and proactive in ensuring their well-being during Holi.4. Maintain hygiene and cleanlinessAfter the festivities are over, it's essential to thoroughly clean and groom your pets to remove any traces of coloured powders or chemicals from their fur and skin. Use mild pet shampoo and lukewarm water to gently wash away the colours, taking care not to scrub too vigorously, as it may irritate their sensitive skin. Pay special attention to their paws, ears, and tail, where colours tend to accumulate, and dry them thoroughly to prevent skin infections or fungal growth.If your pet accidentally ingests coloured powder or water during the celebrations, monitor them closely for any signs of illness or discomfort. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, or difficulty breathing. Prompt medical attention is essential to ensure your pet's swift recovery and prevent any serious health complications.Summing it up, Utpal Khot as a responsible Honorary Animal Welfare Representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India says:(a) Remember to prioritise the safety and well-being of your furry friends. (b) By opting for pet-safe colours, keeping them indoors during the festivities, protecting their eyes and skin, and maintaining proper hygiene, you can ensure that your pets enjoy a happy and healthy Holi experience. (c) Let's celebrate this vibrant festival with love, compassion, and respect for all living beings, including our beloved pets.

This is the first time an actor has been fired from a show like this. While we hear unsubstantiated stories of unprofessional behaviour, this is the first time such conversation has been spoken openly, and with testimonials from coworkers.The two were claimed to have requested the replacement of the show's director and assistant director. This caused problems in the shoot. Shehzada Dhami was cast as the original Armaan Poddar in the show. He was first mocked for his acting abilities, but he eventually improved. This was a tremendous breakthrough for the young star. Today, he shared an edit created by a fan. It is based on the song Tu Thodi Der Thehar Ja and incorporates excerpts from his singles. The actor has not spoken about what went wrong between him and the producers. Netizens reacted to Shehzada's post, a user wrote, ""shehzada reposting Armaan's tu thodi der aur thehar ja edit on his story has me crying like bruh maybe you shouldâve fixed up the edit tho has me in shambles #yrkkh""Another one wrote, ""Ohh Sheh!!! Look at how you slayed! We will cherish ""your Armaan"" forever.""Earlier in a conversation with BT, Shivam Khajuria shared, ""I have worked with Pratiksha for almost a month and Shehzada, too. I felt Pratiksha was not taking her job seriously. She had a great opportunity but she spoiled it. She was quite influenced by Shehzada. I had told her many times to work on her craft but I feel she lost focus after she became great friends with Shehzada. She or Shehzada were never impolite towards me. But, I think the two got enough warnings from the production house and they should have paid heed to them.""

I was told how when they went for the shoot in Mahabaleshwar, he behaved rudely. He continued his behaviour later, too. The crew, lightmen, director, and cameramen are all important people and one has to respect them."""

She revealed that she was attracted to Aditya's leadership abilities and personal integrity.Rani Mukerji opens up on suffering miscarriage after Adira: 'I can't give a sibling to my daughter'In a conversation with Galatta India, she said, âI think heâs a really good human being, and to me, that was the clincher. Iâve grown up in a household with my parents, and Iâve valued the kind of people that they were. In my life, itâs very important to have good people around, because I need to respect people. Thatâs very important to me. What I saw in Adi was a very, very gracious human being, a good person, and a great leader for his team.âShe further added, âHeâs very fair, not in terms of his colour, but in terms of his morals and his judgment. You might fall out of love, or lose that initial attraction, but youâll never lose that respect you have for a person. For me, thatâs very important.

43,"Captain Sanju Samson showcased leadership from the front, delivering an unbeaten 82 runs to guide former champions Rajasthan Royals to a confident 20-run victory over Lucknow Super Giants in their IPL 2024 opener, held at Jaipur's Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Sunday.RR vs LSG: AS IT HAPPENEDSamson's innings, a 52-ball knock, was marked by six powerful sixes and three fours, dominating the ground with spectacular hits across all directions.His performance was pivotal, providing both momentum and stability to the Royals after facing early setbacks in the Powerplay.Supported by Riyan Parag, who contributed 43 runs, the duo formed a solid 93-run partnership for the third wicket, bolstering the Royals' batting lineup in their inaugural match.Although Lucknow Super Giants, despite a shaky start at 11/3, fought back through KL Rahul's 58 and Nicholas Pooran's unbeaten 64, their efforts only managed to narrow down the defeat margin while chasing a formidable target of 194.Rahul, making a comeback to top-flight cricket, showcased his prowess with a composed fifty, scoring 58 off 44 balls, including four fours and two sixes. Additionally, he kept wickets for the full 20 overs, dispelling any doubts regarding his fitness following a quadriceps injury.Pooran, alongside Rahul, exhibited resilience against the opposition, smashing four sixes and as many fours in his 41-ball 64, prolonging the match as much as possible. However, Rajasthan ultimately secured the victory, claiming the two points.Lucknow faced a tumultuous beginning as the Rajasthan Royals' overseas left-arm pairing of Trent Boult (2/35) and debutant Nandre Burger (1/30), stepping in as an impact substitute, inflicted early damage.In an attempt to clear the ropes off Boult's delivery wide of the leg stump, Quinton de Kock found Burger perfectly positioned for the catch, resulting in a straightforward dismissal.Boult continued his assault in the following over, striking Devdutt Padikkal (0) on the helmet with a short ball before sending the next one crashing into the middle stump, dislodging it from the ground.Ayush Badoni (1) then handed an easy catch to Jos Buttler at mid-on off Burger, leaving Lucknow reeling at 11 for three within the first four overs.Deepak Hooda, substituting for Lucknow, initiated a recovery, but the mounting required run rate forced risky strokes.Hooda's aggressive stance yielded a brisk 13-ball 26, adorned with two sixes and two fours, before falling while attempting to clear the ropes against Yuzvendra Chahal, having stitched a crucial 49-run partnership with Rahul for the fourth wicket.With pressure mounting, Rahul spearheaded Lucknow's resurgence alongside Pooran, constructing an 85-run partnership for the fifth wicket, reigniting hopes of victory.Despite the escalating run rate, Rahul and Pooran opted for calculated aggression, selectively targeting bowlers.Rahul's assault on Burger in the 11th over yielded 17 runs, while Pooran unleashed two sixes and a four off Boult in the 13th, accumulating 13 runs.However, Sandeep Sharma (1/22) disrupted Lucknow's momentum, dismissing Rahul, leaving them with 38 runs to chase in the final two overs.The game's fate was sealed in the penultimate over as Sandeep conceded only 11 runs, despite a missed opportunity by Parag to dismiss Pooran.(With PTI inputs)"

Very, very good question.""Meanwhile, Pandya credited his birth place Gujarat for his success but made it clear that cricketing birth took place in Mumbai.""Feels good to be back.

I remember the first time I sneaked in and jumped off a gate, and the security guards were chasing us. It was me and my other best friends. We got pictures with Brett Lee, Kumar Sangakkara, and Mahela Jayawardene (former Punjab Kings players). MI was playing so I also met Sachin sir (Tendulkar).""Discussing his captaincy influences, Gill expressed admiration for India's World Cup-winning skipper MS Dhoni, citing him as an inspiration.However, he emphasized that he will glean numerous insights from Rohit Sharma's captaincy, particularly since he has played the majority of his cricket at the international level under Sharma's leadership.""Mahi (MS Dhoni) bhai, I have not played under him. But watching him as a kid go about things and how he used to handle things is my inspiration. I have played some Tests under Virat Kohli as well. I have played most of my cricket under Rohit Sharma; there are a lot of qualities I will be picking up from him,"" said Gill.On playing against Hardik Pandya, once his captain and teammate in GT and someone under who he has played for India as well in T20Is, Gill said, ""It is going to be interesting. Hardik bhai, I have played for the Indian team and the Gujarat Titans. It is going to be exciting. Hopefully, the stadium will be fully packed, cheering for us. There is nothing better than that.""""I am grateful for what I have achieved so far and hopefully I will be able to achieve a lot more. I cannot pinpoint that this or that thing will be different this time (in him as a player now that he is a captain). But by the time the season ends, if I am happy, my team will be happy and we will make some good memories. If we make some good memories, I would be able to sit back and tell myself that we had a great season,"" concluded Gill.(With ANI inputs)"

Rana's actions constituted two Level 1 offences under Article 2.5 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, resulting in fines of 10 percent and 50 percent of his match fees for the respective breaches.Rana admitted to the infractions and accepted the sanctions imposed by the Match Referee, whose decisions are final and binding for Level 1 breaches.During the match, Rana's animated celebration drew attention as he dismissed Sunrisers Hyderabad's batsman, Mayank Agarwal, prompting controversy and criticism. After claiming Agarwal's wicket with a bouncer, Rana exuberantly blew a flying kiss towards the departing batter, a gesture deemed inappropriate by many, including legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, who expressed disapproval during commentary.WATCH:""He should not have done that. Did the batsman do anything to him when he was hitting him for sixes? Cricket can be played without these antics. It's the age of television. I understand that. Celebrate with your teammates but no need for such antics for the opposition,"" remarked Gavaskar during the commentary.Despite the controversy, KKR managed to secure a thrilling victory over SRH, with Harshit Rana playing a pivotal role in the final over. Rana's resilience and crucial wickets, combined with Andre Russell's explosive half-century, enabled KKR to withstand Heinrich Klaasen's onslaught and clinch a narrow four-run win.Klaasen's blistering 63 off 29 balls, studded with eight sixes, nearly turned the tide in SRH's favor, but KKR's total of 208/7, anchored by Russell's 64 and Phil Salt's 54, proved to be just enough."

SSEL is setting up a facility to manufacture conductors in the YSR District of Andhra Pradesh at an investment cost of Rs 300 crore, Reddy told PTI.  The plant having an annual capacity of 300 tonnes is being set up over 8 acres, he said, adding that the plan is to make the plant operational by the July-September period of 2024-25.  Conductors are a key element of a transmission line project. The plant is being set up in two phases. The trial production will begin by the end of this month, while the peak capacity of phase 1 (200 tonnes) will be achieved in the first quarter of the next fiscal year. Reddy further said SSEL is also into transmission EPC projects and around 50 per cent of the conductors' production will be consumed by the company's transmission business.  The remaining will be sold in the open market to both domestic and international players, he said.  Conductors are a rare product and are mostly imported into the country. The new unit will help improve the availability of domestically manufactured conductors at competitive prices, he said. Established in 1994 as a transformer repairing company, SSEL Group has over the years grown to become India's largest transformer manufacturing company. It is also into setting up transmission projects on an EPC basis. SSEL Group employs around 5,000 people and had a revenue of Rs 2,680 crore in FY 2022-23.

53,"LONDON: In the past few weeks, as illness has sidelined two of Britain’s most visible royal figures, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and King Charles III, one member of the family’s frontbench has stepped into the vacuum: Queen Camilla.Last week, she traveled to the Isle of Man to deliver a speech on Charles’ behalf and met with public officials and community groups.She then flew to Northern Ireland, where she visited a bakery and butcher shop, attended a literary event and accepted salutes at a military parade.Camilla, 76, smiled for the photographers. She betrayed neither the strain of taking care of a cancer-stricken husband, nor that a day later Catherine, who is known as Kate, would announce that she, too, had been diagnosed with cancer.It is the kind of twist of fate that royal watchers savor: Camilla, the woman whose very existence once seemed to threaten the stability of the royal family, has emerged as a stabilizing force during a major royal health crisis.With her husband canceling public engagements while he undergoes treatment, and with Kate out for the foreseeable future for chemotherapy, Camilla has taken on high-profile duties. Her trip to Northern Ireland, scheduled before the king became ill, thrust her onto diplomatically delicate terrain, given the territory’s legacy of sectarian violence and its politically fragile government. By all accounts, she performed well.Camilla is not the only senior royal picking up the load while Charles and Kate are ill. Princess Anne, the king’s sister, has kept up her typically packed diary of royal events. Kate’s husband, Prince William, hopes to return to full-time duties after the Easter holiday, and Charles has continued to meet foreign leaders and hold his weekly session with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Camilla’s emergence does not solve what has become an acute problem for the royal family. She carried out 233 engagements last year, according to The Daily Telegraph, while Charles carried out 425. But both are in their 70s, and the younger generation is not picking up the slack. Even before Kate’s illness, she and William did fewer royal events, citing their young family.“They’re going to have to change what they do,” said Peter Hunt, a former royal correspondent for the BBC. “In the absence of William and Kate, they don’t have the manpower. They are not going to be able to deliver as they once did.”"

55,"When it comes to exercise, the debate between early morning and evening workouts has persisted for years, with proponents of each claiming various benefits. We plan to exercise but fail to stick to it because of a faulty routine system. It is important to stick to a particular fitness routine. The big question is when to exercise. Morning or evening? While both options offer advantages, determining the best time to exercise depends on individual preferences, lifestyle, and goals.Several studies say that morning exercises are good for metabolismMorning exercise can kickstart your metabolism, helping you burn calories throughout the day. Studies suggest that exercising in a fasted state may enhance fat oxidation and improve insulin sensitivity.Engaging in physical activity in the morning can improve mental focus, mood, and productivity for the rest of the day. Exercise releases endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin, which contribute to feelings of happiness and well-being.By exercising early in the day, you're less likely to encounter scheduling conflicts or interruptions, leading to greater consistency and adherence to your workout routine.Morning exercise can help regulate your circadian rhythm, promoting better sleep quality at night. It signals to your body that it's time to wake up, which can improve alertness during the day and facilitate relaxation in the evening.Morning exercise can increase the risk of injuryThere are several demerits of morning exercise. Muscles and joints may be stiff and less flexible in the morning, increasing the risk of injury during vigorous exercise. It's essential to perform proper warm-up exercises to mitigate this risk.Some individuals may experience fatigue or decreased performance during early morning workouts, especially if they haven't had adequate rest or nutrition beforehand.For certain individuals, evening is the best time to exerciseResearch suggests that muscle strength and power may peak in the late afternoon or early evening, potentially leading to improved exercise performance and gains in strength and muscle mass.Evening workouts can serve as a beneficial stress-relief mechanism, allowing individuals to unwind and release tension accumulated throughout the day. Exercise triggers the release of endorphins, which promote relaxation and alleviate stress.Muscles and joints tend to be warmer and more flexible later in the day, reducing the risk of injury and enhancing range of motion during exercise.Evening workouts offer opportunities for social interaction and group exercise classes, fostering camaraderie and accountability among participants.Evening exercise can affect your sleep scheduleEvening workouts may be susceptible to scheduling conflicts, fatigue, or unexpected events that arise during the day, leading to missed workouts or reduced motivation.Restless nights? Uncover the secrets to a restful sleepExercising too close to bedtime may disrupt sleep patterns in some individuals, particularly if the activity is vigorous or stimulating. It's advisable to allow sufficient time for post-exercise wind-down and relaxation before bedtime.How to choose the best time to exercise?Ultimately, the best time to exercise is the time that aligns with your schedule, preferences, and body's natural rhythm. Consider the following factors when determining your ideal workout time:Some individuals thrive on the energy and productivity of morning workouts, while others prefer the stress-relief and social aspects of evening exercise. Choose the time that feels most comfortable and enjoyable for you.Assess your daily commitments, work schedule, and family obligations to identify windows of time conducive to regular exercise. Consistency is key to long-term success, so prioritize a time that you can consistently dedicate to physical activity.Tailor your workout timing to align with your fitness goals. If you're aiming to boost metabolism and energy levels, morning exercise may be beneficial. Alternatively, if you're focused on strength gains or performance improvements, evening workouts might be more suitable.Pay attention to your body's cues and energy levels throughout the day. Experiment with different workout times to determine when you feel most energized, focused, and ready to exercise."
56,"After undergoing a major abdominal surgery in January this year, Kate Middleton has been diagnosed with cancer. The Princess of Wales has updated about her health condition via a video message which has been released through the official Instagram account. In the video, Kate says she underwent abdominal surgery which was successful and was a non-cancerous condition.However, subsequent tests revealed of cancerous growth in her body.The nature of cancer has not been revealed. She said that currently she is in the early stages of treatment. ""My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment,"" said Kate dressed in jeans and a jumper. She looked pale and tired in the video.Due to her health condition and post-surgery Kate was absent from public life which stirred intense speculation.Abdominal surgery plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of various types of cancer affecting organs within the abdominal cavity. Surgeons may perform procedures such as tumor resection, lymph node dissection, or organ removal to remove cancerous tissues and prevent the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Advancements in surgical techniques, such as minimally invasive procedures and robotic-assisted surgery, have improved outcomes and reduced recovery times for many cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery. These approaches often result in smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery.However, abdominal surgery itself can pose risks, including bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding organs or tissues. Additionally, surgery may impact digestive function, necessitating dietary modifications or long-term medical management. In cases where cancer has metastasized to abdominal organs, surgery may be part of a multidisciplinary approach alongside chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy. For example, ovarian cancer often requires abdominal surgery to remove tumors and affected tissues, followed by chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells.Overall, abdominal surgery remains an integral component of cancer treatment, offering the potential for disease removal or control while requiring careful consideration of risks and benefits for each patient. News of Kate's health condition is another blow to the British Royal Family as King Charles III is also undergoing cancer treatment. The King was seeking treatment for enlarged prostate and later it was revealed that he has cancer for which he was receiving treatment for prostate; but it is not prostate cancer an official spokesperson has confirmed. Duchess of York, Sarah Fergusson is another royal family member who is battling melanoma.How early screening is important in cancer detection and treatment"
57,"Nutrition to power your breakfastIt is said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day! And with the rising interest in healthy living and dietary choices, health-conscious people are including a variety of grains that provide fibre into their breakfast choices. These nutrient-rich grains not only serve as vital energy sources but also offer a plethora of essential nutrients.For at least 10,000 years, grains have been at the core of most diets around the world. Whether it's maize in Mexico, rice in Asia, or wheat in the East, people worldwide continue to depend on grains as a fundamental dietary staple. For centuries, they have also remained a fundamental part of the traditional diet in India, offering a wealth of vital nutrients and serving as a pivotal source of energy.Ragi or finger millet is one such grain that has been traditionally consumed for breakfast in the southern part of India. The small red grains of ragi pack quite a punch and are high in fiber, protein, and nutrients. Ragi is gluten-free and contain healthy unsaturated fats that can help lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease, and improve overall heart health.Ragi: A nutritional powerhouseRagi's journey from obscurity to prominence in the health food domain is thanks to its nutritional prowess. Packed with essential nutrients including vitamin C, vitamin E, B-complex vitamins, iron, calcium, and antioxidants, this gluten-free grain has emerged as a favourite among nutritionists and health enthusiasts alike. It offers a plethora of health benefits, which is why state governments have been urged to prioritise the production and promotion of coarse grains, particularly bajra and ragi, across various levels. This initiative encompasses increased production, exemplified by efforts in Karnataka and Odisha, as well as integration into school midday meals, aimed at enhancing physical and mental health. Such practices have been observed in southern states as well as Delhi, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.A superfood with a nutrient-rich profileWhat makes ragi such a standout among other millets? Or for that matter, even among superfoods? The answer lies in its impressive nutrient profile for one! From a nutritional perspective, it is significant as it has been widely acknowledged to have elevated levels of calcium (0.38%), dietary fibre (18%), and phenolic compounds (0.3â3%). It is known for several health benefits, some of which are attributed to its polyphenol and dietary fibre contents. Bone strengthening qualities of RagiAccording to Nadiya Merchant, associate director, Nutrition, Kellogg India, âThe unparalleled calcium content in ragi is noteworthy as the mineral is crucial for maintaining bone health, preventing osteoporosis, and supporting muscle function. The surprising levels of calcium in the grain make it a super choice for those looking to fortify their skeletal system naturally. They are also recognized for their health-beneficial effects, such as anti-diabetic, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.âBeats iron deficiencyRagi also serves as an effective solution to counter iron deficiency, which is a common nutritional concern worldwide, particularly among women and children. Studies have demonstrated that incorporating ragi porridge supplementation positively impacts haemoglobin levels among adolescent high school girls. In addition to its mineral content, ragi being rich in dietary fibre helps to promote digestive health.Weight loss qualities of RagiRagi is an excellent food for controlling diabetes and losing weight. Because of its high fiber content, it helps you feel fuller and consume less calories overall. Because of their low glycemic index, the complex carbs in ragi aid in improved calorie management.Ragi is also a source of protein and has a relatively balanced essential amino acid profile - containing all nine essential amino acids required by the human body. This makes it a valuable protein source, particularly for vegetarians and vegans who may struggle to obtain sufficient protein from plant-based sources alone. Protein plays a crucial role in promoting muscle growth, aiding in repair, weight loss and maintaining overall health.Offers diversity as a breakfast optionApart from the nutritional benefits, ragi offers versatility in the kitchen, lending itself to a wide range of culinary creations. From traditional South Indian dishes like ragi mudde (steamed ragi balls), dosa and idli to modern adaptations such as ragi smoothies and baked goods, the possibilities are endless. Ragiâs mild, nutty flavour pairs well with both sweet and savoury ingredients, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks alike. They can be used to make several products like porridge, rotis, and flakes or incorporated into convenient breakfast cereals that are easy to prepare, yet nourishing and rich in vitamins, low in fat and cholesterol-free. To date, parents are advised to feed their infants and young kids ragi porridge as a breakfast option due to its high nutritional value and easy digestibility. The introduction of new-age dishes like ragi pancakes to savouries and drinks is not only going beyond traditional dishes to offer nutrition, but they are also offering diversity in terms of textures and tastes. This addition enriches our gastronomic experiences.No gym required! Yoga for a flat stomach by Himalayan Siddhaa Akshar"

She said, ""Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too."" As is the affection, encouragement, and kindness so many of you have shown. It is really important to us both.""Cancer is a complex disease characterized by abnormal cell growth that can spread to other parts of the body. It can affect various organs and tissues, causing symptoms such as lumps, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and changes in bowel or bladder habits.

The actress captioned the video, ""Nothing is more important than your self-respect.""One can wonder if Honmukhe's caption and posted reel have anything to do with his surprise departure from the show.Earlier, Rohit Purohit exclusively spoke to BT about the comparison, he said, âYes, comparisons are bound to happen when you replace an actor in a popular show. However, I donât feel pressured because of my extensive experience in the industry and my confidence in my craft. I understand there are expectations from the makers and the audience. I will make sure I give my best and be accepted as the new Armaan Poddar. Over the years, I have come to understand that the audience first forges a connection with a character and the actor portraying the part comes in much later. I donât see replacing someone as a challenge because I have learnt the importance of staying true to the character. If I do that, the audience will naturally connect with me. I am sure I will make a place in their hearts and won't disappoint them.âAfter firing the two actors, the production house cast Rohit Purohit from Porus and Garvita Sadhwani from Baatein Kuch Ankahee Si to play Shehzada and Pratiksha's roles, respectively.
