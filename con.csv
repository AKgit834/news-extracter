Surgeons may perform procedures such as tumor resection, lymph node dissection, or organ removal to remove cancerous tissues and prevent the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Advancements in surgical techniques, such as minimally invasive procedures and robotic-assisted surgery, have improved outcomes and reduced recovery times for many cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery. These approaches often result in smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108724066""></div></div><br>However, abdominal surgery itself can pose risks, including bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding organs or tissues. Additionally, surgery may impact digestive function, necessitating dietary modifications or long-term medical management. <br>In cases where cancer has metastasized to abdominal organs, surgery may be part of a multidisciplinary approach alongside chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy. For example, ovarian cancer often requires abdominal surgery to remove tumors and affected tissues, followed by chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells.<br>Overall, abdominal surgery remains an integral component of <!-- -->cancer treatment<!-- -->, offering the potential for disease removal or control while requiring careful consideration of risks and benefits for each patient. <br>News of Kate's health condition is another blow to the British Royal Family as King Charles III is also undergoing cancer treatment.

He acknowledged the significant role marketing plays in a film's success and admitted that perhaps his films lacked adequate marketing efforts. Reflecting on his initial belief that his role as an artist was complete after creating the film, he realized the importance of marketing in attracting audiences to theaters.<br><br>Randeep reflected on the fact that some of his films didn't perform well due to a lack of support, even from producers. He emphasizes that a film's success is often attributed to effective marketing and positioning, which requires a relentless and significant financial investment. Unfortunately, he feels that he didn't receive this level of support in many of his films. Mentioning delayed releases and insufficient backing from studios, he acknowledges that these responsibilities lie with the producer. Taking charge as the producer of his current film, he assures that audiences will have widespread access to it.<br></div>"

However, amidst all the vibrant hues and festivities, it's essential to ensure the safety and well-being of our <!-- -->furry companions<!-- -->. As pet owners, it's our responsibility to celebrate Holi in a manner that keeps our pets safe from harm. In this article, we'll explore how you can enjoy a <!-- -->pet-friendly Holi<!-- --> while safeguarding your beloved animals from toxic colours and other potential hazards. Let us also look at basic suggestions and guidelines given by the <!-- -->Animal Welfare Board of India<!-- --> for Animal safety.<br><span class=""strong "">Tips to ensure </span><span class=""strong "">pet safety</span><span class=""strong ""> during Holi:</span><br>1. Opt for <!-- -->pet-safe colours<br>When planning your <!-- -->Holi celebrations<!-- -->, make sure to choose pet-friendly colours that are non-toxic and safe for animals. Avoid using traditional synthetic colours that contain harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be extremely harmful if ingested by your pets. Instead, opt for natural and organic colours made from ingredients such as turmeric, beetroot, and spinach, which are not only safe but also eco-friendly.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751140"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>Additionally, you can create DIY pet-safe colours at home using ingredients readily available in your kitchen. For example, turmeric mixed with flour can create a vibrant yellow colour, while beetroot juice diluted with water can produce a lovely shade of pink. Get creative and experiment with different natural ingredients to make colourful powders and water-based paints that are safe for your pets to play with.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108751140""></div></div><br>2. Keep your pets indoors<br>On the day of Holi, it's advisable to keep your pets indoors to protect them from the chaos and commotion associated with the festivities. Loud noises, crowded streets, and unfamiliar faces can cause stress and anxiety in animals, leading to undesirable behaviour or even accidents. Create a safe and comfortable space for your pets inside your home, away from the hustle and bustle of the celebrations, where they can feel secure and relaxed.<br>If you have outdoor pets such as dogs or cats, consider bringing them indoors a day before and after Holi to minimize their exposure to coloured powders and water. Provide them with plenty of food, water, and toys to keep them entertained while they wait out the festivities indoors. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your pet's well-being.<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Protect your pet's eyes and skin<br>If you decide to include your pets in the Holi celebrations, take extra precautions to shield their eyes and skin from coloured powders and water. Consider dressing your pets in lightweight clothing or applying a coat of pet-safe sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful UV rays and colour stains. Additionally, use protective eyewear or pet goggles to prevent coloured powder from getting into their eyes, which can cause irritation or infection.<br>Keep a close eye on your pets during the celebrations and intervene immediately if you notice any signs of discomfort or distress. Provide them with plenty of fresh water to drink and a shady spot to rest if they become overheated or tired. Remember, your pets rely on you to keep them safe, so be vigilant and proactive in ensuring their well-being during Holi.<br>4. Maintain hygiene and cleanliness<br>After the festivities are over, it's essential to thoroughly clean and groom your pets to remove any traces of coloured powders or chemicals from their fur and skin. Use mild pet shampoo and lukewarm water to gently wash away the colours, taking care not to scrub too vigorously, as it may irritate their sensitive skin. Pay special attention to their paws, ears, and tail, where colours tend to accumulate, and dry them thoroughly to prevent skin infections or fungal growth.<br>If your pet accidentally ingests coloured powder or water during the celebrations, monitor them closely for any signs of illness or discomfort. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, or difficulty breathing. Prompt medical attention is essential to ensure your pet's swift recovery and prevent any serious health complications.<br>Summing it up, <!-- -->Utpal Khot<!-- --> as a responsible Honorary Animal Welfare Representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India says:<br>(a) Remember to prioritise the safety and well-being of your furry friends. <br>(b) By opting for pet-safe colours, keeping them indoors during the festivities, protecting their eyes and skin, and maintaining proper hygiene, you can ensure that your pets enjoy a happy and healthy Holi experience. <br>(c) Let's celebrate this vibrant festival with love, compassion, and respect for all living beings, including our beloved pets.

The reason lies in the subtle tilt of the Moon’s orbital plane. The Moon’s path around the Earth is inclined at an angle of approximately 5.145° to the ecliptic plane—the apparent path that the Sun traces through the sky over the year. This inclination means that the Moon often passes slightly above or below the direct line between the Earth and the Sun, sparing it from the Earth’s shadow most months.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108750665"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>When the conditions do align, and the Moon skirts through the Earth’s shadow, the type and duration of the eclipse are further influenced by the proximity of the Moon to its nodes. The nodes are the two points where the Moon’s orbit intersects the ecliptic plane. A lunar eclipse can only occur when the full moon is near one of these nodes, allowing the Earth’s shadow to envelop the Moon. If the full moon occurs too far from these nodes, the alignment is not suitable for an eclipse, and the Moon remains brightly lit by the Sun’s unobstructed rays.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108750665""></div></div><br>The inclination of the Moon’s orbit is not a static figure but exhibits a slight oscillation over time, known as the lunar nodal cycle, which spans approximately 18.6 years. This cycle causes the conditions for eclipses to wax and wane, contributing to the varying frequency and type of lunar eclipses we observe from Earth. The interplay of these orbital mechanics ensures that each lunar eclipse is a unique event, with its own timing, duration, and visual characteristics.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""26""><h4>The Earth’s shadow <br></h4></div><br>The Earth’s shadow is a fundamental element in the occurrence of lunar eclipses, and understanding its two distinct parts—the <!-- -->umbra<!-- --> and the penumbra—is key to comprehending the different types of eclipses we observe. The umbra is the central, darkest portion of the shadow where the Earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. This area is where the most dramatic part of a lunar eclipse unfolds. When the Moon ventures into the umbra during an eclipse, it can lead to a partial or total eclipse, depending on how much of the Moon’s surface is obscured. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon is engulfed in the umbra, leading to the Moon’s complete immersion in shadow and often resulting in a striking, coppery-red coloration known as a “Blood Moon.”<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Source: Canva</div></div></div><br>Surrounding the umbra is the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/penumbra"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">penumbra</a>, a lighter shadow where the Sun’s light is only partially blocked by the Earth. This results in a subtle shading on the Moon’s surface rather than a full blackout. A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through this faint shadow, and the change in the Moon’s appearance is so slight that it can be difficult to detect without careful observation. The penumbral shadow’s effect is a gradient of darkness, with the deepest part closest to the umbra and gradually lightening as it stretches away. Penumbral eclipses are less spectacular than their umbral counterparts but are still an essential part of the trio of lunar eclipses, providing a delicate preamble or conclusion to the more noticeable phases of the eclipse<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""38""><h4>Types of Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>There are three types of lunar eclipses that one must know about: penumbral, partial, and total. A penumbral eclipse is the least noticeable, as the Moon only moves through the Earth’s penumbral shadow, causing a slight shading on the Moon’s surface. In a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon passes through the umbra, leading to a segment of the Moon appearing darkened. The most striking is the total lunar eclipse, where the entire Moon falls within the Earth’s umbral shadow, often acquiring a reddish hue due to the Earth’s atmosphere filtering and refracting sunlight.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""42""><h4>The role of Earth’s atmosphere</h4></div><br>During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon’s visibility and its reddish hue are indeed fascinating consequences of Earth’s atmosphere. As the Moon enters the Earth’s umbra, it is enveloped in a deep shadow, yet it does not become invisible. Instead, it glows with a reddish tint, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This occurs because the Earth’s atmosphere acts like a lens, refracting or bending the sunlight, especially the red wavelengths, towards the Moon. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter away, while the longer red wavelengths penetrate the atmosphere and reach the Moon. The specific shade of red can vary based on atmospheric conditions such as the amount of dust, ash, or clouds present. For instance, a volcanic eruption that releases fine particles into the atmosphere can result in a deeper red or even a darker eclipse. <br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""46""><h4>Observing Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>Lunar eclipses are unique in that they can be observed from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon during the eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses, which require protective eyewear, lunar eclipses can be safely viewed with the naked eye. These events provide not only a spectacular show but also an opportunity for scientific study, allowing astronomers to learn more about the Earth’s atmosphere and the astronomical mechanics of our planet and its natural satellite.<br><div class=""lOvcW""><div class=""ge4Md"" style=""min-height:290px""><div data-type=""in_view"" class=""loadable-inview  ""><div><span class=""UzraQ null""><span class=""aQKeu loadeblecomponentloader""></span></span></div></div></div><p class=""efT4r"">Trump Warns ‘Bloodbath’ if he is not elected, Biden Slams with ‘Loser to Get Another Electoral Defeat’</p></div><br></div>"

Their journey to this <!-- -->Brazilian island<!-- --> is shrouded in mystery, with some believing they arrived from a shipwreck off the coast, while others claim they were brought over by prisoners escaping from French Guiana. Regardless of their origins, these buffaloes have thrived in Marajó's tropical climate, now numbering around half a million, surpassing the human population of 440,000.<br>These buffaloes are not merely a novelty; they are deeply integrated into the local culture and economy. They serve as work animals, dragging carriages through the streets of Soure, assisting farmers in the fields, and even participating in local festivals featuring buffalo races.

The ""<!-- -->Buffalo Soldiers<!-- -->"" of Marajó, a term that nods to the 19th-century US army regiments and popularized by Bob Marley's reggae classic, are a unit of military police who ride buffaloes equipped with specially-adapted seats.

He emphasized the profound ""love"" he feels from his supporters, attributing this enduring connection as a fundamental element of his resurgence.<br>Discussing the implications of the 2020 <!-- --> and subsequent events, Trump maintained his controversial stance, asserting, ""Jan. 6 was a protest against a rigged election."" Despite the contentious nature of this claim, it underlines his perception of his political standing and the rationale behind his continued influence within the Republican Party, the Washington Examiner report said.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751896"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>Furthermore, Trump touched upon the impact of recent legal challenges on his popularity, suggesting that adversarial actions have inadvertently bolstered his support. ""I think it’s raised me 25%,"" he claimed, highlighting a paradox where legal indictments seem to have amplified his political capital rather than diminished it.<br>In addressing his return to the political arena, Trump conveyed a sense of inevitability about his candidacy, driven by a conviction of widespread electoral support and a belief in rectifying perceived injustices. He elucidated his thought process, indicating that the notion of campaigning commenced immediately following the 2020 election results, spurred by a sense of mission rather than conventional political ambition.<br>Trump's commentary provides a unique glimpse into the mindset of a former President poised for a potential electoral comeback. The interaction with supporters at Mar-a-Lago, combined with his reflections on political and personal challenges, paints a picture of a figure who continues to wield significant influence within the American political landscape.<br></div>"

Surgeons may perform procedures such as tumor resection, lymph node dissection, or organ removal to remove cancerous tissues and prevent the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Advancements in surgical techniques, such as minimally invasive procedures and robotic-assisted surgery, have improved outcomes and reduced recovery times for many cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery. These approaches often result in smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108724066""></div></div><br>However, abdominal surgery itself can pose risks, including bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding organs or tissues. Additionally, surgery may impact digestive function, necessitating dietary modifications or long-term medical management. <br>In cases where cancer has metastasized to abdominal organs, surgery may be part of a multidisciplinary approach alongside chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy. For example, ovarian cancer often requires abdominal surgery to remove tumors and affected tissues, followed by chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells.<br>Overall, abdominal surgery remains an integral component of <!-- -->cancer treatment<!-- -->, offering the potential for disease removal or control while requiring careful consideration of risks and benefits for each patient. <br>News of Kate's health condition is another blow to the British Royal Family as King Charles III is also undergoing cancer treatment.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">Holi, the festival of colours, is a joyous occasion celebrated by millions across the globe. However, amidst all the vibrant hues and festivities, it's essential to ensure the safety and well-being of our <!-- -->furry companions<!-- -->. As pet owners, it's our responsibility to celebrate Holi in a manner that keeps our pets safe from harm. In this article, we'll explore how you can enjoy a <!-- -->pet-friendly Holi<!-- --> while safeguarding your beloved animals from toxic colours and other potential hazards. Let us also look at basic suggestions and guidelines given by the <!-- -->Animal Welfare Board of India<!-- --> for Animal safety.<br><span class=""strong "">Tips to ensure </span><span class=""strong "">pet safety</span><span class=""strong ""> during Holi:</span><br>1. Opt for <!-- -->pet-safe colours<br>When planning your <!-- -->Holi celebrations<!-- -->, make sure to choose pet-friendly colours that are non-toxic and safe for animals. Avoid using traditional synthetic colours that contain harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be extremely harmful if ingested by your pets. Instead, opt for natural and organic colours made from ingredients such as turmeric, beetroot, and spinach, which are not only safe but also eco-friendly.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751140"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>Additionally, you can create DIY pet-safe colours at home using ingredients readily available in your kitchen. For example, turmeric mixed with flour can create a vibrant yellow colour, while beetroot juice diluted with water can produce a lovely shade of pink. Get creative and experiment with different natural ingredients to make colourful powders and water-based paints that are safe for your pets to play with.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108751140""></div></div><br>2. Keep your pets indoors<br>On the day of Holi, it's advisable to keep your pets indoors to protect them from the chaos and commotion associated with the festivities. Loud noises, crowded streets, and unfamiliar faces can cause stress and anxiety in animals, leading to undesirable behaviour or even accidents. Create a safe and comfortable space for your pets inside your home, away from the hustle and bustle of the celebrations, where they can feel secure and relaxed.<br>If you have outdoor pets such as dogs or cats, consider bringing them indoors a day before and after Holi to minimize their exposure to coloured powders and water. Provide them with plenty of food, water, and toys to keep them entertained while they wait out the festivities indoors. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your pet's well-being.<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Protect your pet's eyes and skin<br>If you decide to include your pets in the Holi celebrations, take extra precautions to shield their eyes and skin from coloured powders and water. Consider dressing your pets in lightweight clothing or applying a coat of pet-safe sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful UV rays and colour stains. Additionally, use protective eyewear or pet goggles to prevent coloured powder from getting into their eyes, which can cause irritation or infection.<br>Keep a close eye on your pets during the celebrations and intervene immediately if you notice any signs of discomfort or distress. Provide them with plenty of fresh water to drink and a shady spot to rest if they become overheated or tired. Remember, your pets rely on you to keep them safe, so be vigilant and proactive in ensuring their well-being during Holi.<br>4. Maintain hygiene and cleanliness<br>After the festivities are over, it's essential to thoroughly clean and groom your pets to remove any traces of coloured powders or chemicals from their fur and skin. Use mild pet shampoo and lukewarm water to gently wash away the colours, taking care not to scrub too vigorously, as it may irritate their sensitive skin. Pay special attention to their paws, ears, and tail, where colours tend to accumulate, and dry them thoroughly to prevent skin infections or fungal growth.<br>If your pet accidentally ingests coloured powder or water during the celebrations, monitor them closely for any signs of illness or discomfort. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, or difficulty breathing. Prompt medical attention is essential to ensure your pet's swift recovery and prevent any serious health complications.<br>Summing it up, <!-- -->Utpal Khot<!-- --> as a responsible Honorary Animal Welfare Representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India says:<br>(a) Remember to prioritise the safety and well-being of your furry friends. <br>(b) By opting for pet-safe colours, keeping them indoors during the festivities, protecting their eyes and skin, and maintaining proper hygiene, you can ensure that your pets enjoy a happy and healthy Holi experience. <br>(c) Let's celebrate this vibrant festival with love, compassion, and respect for all living beings, including our beloved pets.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">A <!-- -->lunar eclipse<!-- --> is a celestial event that occurs when the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/earth"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">Earth</a> comes between the Sun and the <a href=""https://www.speakingtree.in/topics/universe/moon"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">Moon</a>, casting a shadow on the Moon. This fascinating phenomenon has intrigued humans for millennia, and today, we understand the <!-- -->science<!-- --> behind it. In this article, we’ll explore the causes of a lunar eclipse and the science that explains how and why they occur.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""10""><h4>The alignment of Sun, Earth, and Moon and the lunar nodal cycle</h4></div><br>For a lunar eclipse to take place, the Sun, Earth, and Moon must be closely aligned in a straight line, an arrangement known as syzygy.<div class=""persObserver personaliseWidgetLoader_108750665 elU3m iTamo undefined"" data-card=""readAlso"" data-heading="""" data-section=""Etimes"" data-subsection=""Trending"" id=""readAlso_108750665"" data-msid=""108750665"" data-template=""AS"" data-contentprimestatus=""non-prime"" data-userprimestatus=""non-prime"" style=""min-height:330.06px""></div>This <!-- -->alignment<!-- --> happens only during a full moon when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. <br>However, despite the monthly occurrence of a full moon, we do not witness a lunar eclipse each time. The reason lies in the subtle tilt of the Moon’s orbital plane. The Moon’s path around the Earth is inclined at an angle of approximately 5.145° to the ecliptic plane—the apparent path that the Sun traces through the sky over the year. This inclination means that the Moon often passes slightly above or below the direct line between the Earth and the Sun, sparing it from the Earth’s shadow most months.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108750665"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>When the conditions do align, and the Moon skirts through the Earth’s shadow, the type and duration of the eclipse are further influenced by the proximity of the Moon to its nodes. The nodes are the two points where the Moon’s orbit intersects the ecliptic plane. A lunar eclipse can only occur when the full moon is near one of these nodes, allowing the Earth’s shadow to envelop the Moon. If the full moon occurs too far from these nodes, the alignment is not suitable for an eclipse, and the Moon remains brightly lit by the Sun’s unobstructed rays.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108750665""></div></div><br>The inclination of the Moon’s orbit is not a static figure but exhibits a slight oscillation over time, known as the lunar nodal cycle, which spans approximately 18.6 years. This cycle causes the conditions for eclipses to wax and wane, contributing to the varying frequency and type of lunar eclipses we observe from Earth. The interplay of these orbital mechanics ensures that each lunar eclipse is a unique event, with its own timing, duration, and visual characteristics.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""26""><h4>The Earth’s shadow <br></h4></div><br>The Earth’s shadow is a fundamental element in the occurrence of lunar eclipses, and understanding its two distinct parts—the <!-- -->umbra<!-- --> and the penumbra—is key to comprehending the different types of eclipses we observe. The umbra is the central, darkest portion of the shadow where the Earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. This area is where the most dramatic part of a lunar eclipse unfolds. When the Moon ventures into the umbra during an eclipse, it can lead to a partial or total eclipse, depending on how much of the Moon’s surface is obscured. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon is engulfed in the umbra, leading to the Moon’s complete immersion in shadow and often resulting in a striking, coppery-red coloration known as a “Blood Moon.”<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Source: Canva</div></div></div><br>Surrounding the umbra is the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/penumbra"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">penumbra</a>, a lighter shadow where the Sun’s light is only partially blocked by the Earth. This results in a subtle shading on the Moon’s surface rather than a full blackout. A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through this faint shadow, and the change in the Moon’s appearance is so slight that it can be difficult to detect without careful observation. The penumbral shadow’s effect is a gradient of darkness, with the deepest part closest to the umbra and gradually lightening as it stretches away. Penumbral eclipses are less spectacular than their umbral counterparts but are still an essential part of the trio of lunar eclipses, providing a delicate preamble or conclusion to the more noticeable phases of the eclipse<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""38""><h4>Types of Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>There are three types of lunar eclipses that one must know about: penumbral, partial, and total. A penumbral eclipse is the least noticeable, as the Moon only moves through the Earth’s penumbral shadow, causing a slight shading on the Moon’s surface. In a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon passes through the umbra, leading to a segment of the Moon appearing darkened. The most striking is the total lunar eclipse, where the entire Moon falls within the Earth’s umbral shadow, often acquiring a reddish hue due to the Earth’s atmosphere filtering and refracting sunlight.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""42""><h4>The role of Earth’s atmosphere</h4></div><br>During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon’s visibility and its reddish hue are indeed fascinating consequences of Earth’s atmosphere. As the Moon enters the Earth’s umbra, it is enveloped in a deep shadow, yet it does not become invisible. Instead, it glows with a reddish tint, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This occurs because the Earth’s atmosphere acts like a lens, refracting or bending the sunlight, especially the red wavelengths, towards the Moon. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter away, while the longer red wavelengths penetrate the atmosphere and reach the Moon. The specific shade of red can vary based on atmospheric conditions such as the amount of dust, ash, or clouds present. For instance, a volcanic eruption that releases fine particles into the atmosphere can result in a deeper red or even a darker eclipse. <br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""46""><h4>Observing Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>Lunar eclipses are unique in that they can be observed from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon during the eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses, which require protective eyewear, lunar eclipses can be safely viewed with the naked eye. These events provide not only a spectacular show but also an opportunity for scientific study, allowing astronomers to learn more about the Earth’s atmosphere and the astronomical mechanics of our planet and its natural satellite.<br><div class=""lOvcW""><div class=""ge4Md"" style=""min-height:290px""><div data-type=""in_view"" class=""loadable-inview  ""><div><span class=""UzraQ null""><span class=""aQKeu loadeblecomponentloader""></span></span></div></div></div><p class=""efT4r"">Trump Warns ‘Bloodbath’ if he is not elected, Biden Slams with ‘Loser to Get Another Electoral Defeat’</p></div><br></div>"

I bowl in different stages of the game. The body is ageing. (It) requires (a) different mindset,” he said.<br>""I came from a Test series.

Their journey to this <!-- -->Brazilian island<!-- --> is shrouded in mystery, with some believing they arrived from a shipwreck off the coast, while others claim they were brought over by prisoners escaping from French Guiana. Regardless of their origins, these buffaloes have thrived in Marajó's tropical climate, now numbering around half a million, surpassing the human population of 440,000.<br>These buffaloes are not merely a novelty; they are deeply integrated into the local culture and economy. They serve as work animals, dragging carriages through the streets of Soure, assisting farmers in the fields, and even participating in local festivals featuring buffalo races. Their presence is also felt in the culinary scene, with buffalo steaks and mozzarella gracing restaurant menus.<br>But perhaps the most striking role these creatures play is in law enforcement. The ""<!-- -->Buffalo Soldiers<!-- -->"" of Marajó, a term that nods to the 19th-century US army regiments and popularized by Bob Marley's reggae classic, are a unit of military police who ride buffaloes equipped with specially-adapted seats.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">Men’s grooming is a very important aspect of our lives, and keeping in mind that men are very particular about their beards and having a good beard trimmer is very important. It is one such tool that comes with stainless steel blades on the inside and is powered by a motor that either runs through electricity or batteries to give your beard a perfect shape by trimming it in a very easy manner. Trimming is by far one of the easiest methods through which you can shape your beard in the best way possible. However, all this can be possible if you can maintain your beard trimmer properly. If you have a beard trimmer that is not cleaned even after several uses, then that particular trimmer might not be able to help you groom yourself in the best way possible. To make sure you stay nicely groomed all the time, this article will help you learn how to maintain and clean beard trimmers. <br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""2""><h2 style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"">How to Clean Beard Trimmers?</h2></div><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""3""><ul><li>The first thing to remember is that you must clean a trimmer after each use.<br></li><li>To clean the trimmer in the best way possible, make sure you rinse it in water.

His breakfast often comes from McDonald's, and he is known to have used borrowed furniture when his children were young. His hobbies include playing bridge, golfing, and strumming on one of his 22 ukuleles, a skill he used to charm his first wife, Susan.<br>The bulk of Buffett's wealth is tied to Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that has amassed over $1 trillion in assets. His journey to riches began at an early age, investing in stocks at 11 and filing taxes by 13. Despite his fortune, the majority of his wealth was accumulated after his 50th birthday, with his annual salary from Berkshire Hathaway remaining at $100,000 for the last 40 years, the Insider report said.<br>Although Buffett has had his share of investment missteps, such as a Sinclair gas station, these have been vastly outweighed by his successes.

He once expressed at a shareholder meeting, ""There are things money can't buy... My life couldn't be happier. In fact, it'd be worse if I had six or eight houses.

Surgeons may perform procedures such as tumor resection, lymph node dissection, or organ removal to remove cancerous tissues and prevent the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Advancements in surgical techniques, such as minimally invasive procedures and robotic-assisted surgery, have improved outcomes and reduced recovery times for many cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery. These approaches often result in smaller incisions, less pain, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108724066""></div></div><br>However, abdominal surgery itself can pose risks, including bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding organs or tissues. Additionally, surgery may impact digestive function, necessitating dietary modifications or long-term medical management. <br>In cases where cancer has metastasized to abdominal organs, surgery may be part of a multidisciplinary approach alongside chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy. For example, ovarian cancer often requires abdominal surgery to remove tumors and affected tissues, followed by chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells.<br>Overall, abdominal surgery remains an integral component of <!-- -->cancer treatment<!-- -->, offering the potential for disease removal or control while requiring careful consideration of risks and benefits for each patient. <br>News of Kate's health condition is another blow to the British Royal Family as King Charles III is also undergoing cancer treatment.

Opt for <!-- -->pet-safe colours<br>When planning your <!-- -->Holi celebrations<!-- -->, make sure to choose pet-friendly colours that are non-toxic and safe for animals. Avoid using traditional synthetic colours that contain harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be extremely harmful if ingested by your pets. Instead, opt for natural and organic colours made from ingredients such as turmeric, beetroot, and spinach, which are not only safe but also eco-friendly.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751140"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>Additionally, you can create DIY pet-safe colours at home using ingredients readily available in your kitchen. For example, turmeric mixed with flour can create a vibrant yellow colour, while beetroot juice diluted with water can produce a lovely shade of pink. Get creative and experiment with different natural ingredients to make colourful powders and water-based paints that are safe for your pets to play with.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108751140""></div></div><br>2. Keep your pets indoors<br>On the day of Holi, it's advisable to keep your pets indoors to protect them from the chaos and commotion associated with the festivities. Loud noises, crowded streets, and unfamiliar faces can cause stress and anxiety in animals, leading to undesirable behaviour or even accidents. Create a safe and comfortable space for your pets inside your home, away from the hustle and bustle of the celebrations, where they can feel secure and relaxed.<br>If you have outdoor pets such as dogs or cats, consider bringing them indoors a day before and after Holi to minimize their exposure to coloured powders and water. Provide them with plenty of food, water, and toys to keep them entertained while they wait out the festivities indoors. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your pet's well-being.<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Protect your pet's eyes and skin<br>If you decide to include your pets in the Holi celebrations, take extra precautions to shield their eyes and skin from coloured powders and water. Consider dressing your pets in lightweight clothing or applying a coat of pet-safe sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful UV rays and colour stains. Additionally, use protective eyewear or pet goggles to prevent coloured powder from getting into their eyes, which can cause irritation or infection.<br>Keep a close eye on your pets during the celebrations and intervene immediately if you notice any signs of discomfort or distress. Provide them with plenty of fresh water to drink and a shady spot to rest if they become overheated or tired. Remember, your pets rely on you to keep them safe, so be vigilant and proactive in ensuring their well-being during Holi.<br>4. Maintain hygiene and cleanliness<br>After the festivities are over, it's essential to thoroughly clean and groom your pets to remove any traces of coloured powders or chemicals from their fur and skin. Use mild pet shampoo and lukewarm water to gently wash away the colours, taking care not to scrub too vigorously, as it may irritate their sensitive skin. Pay special attention to their paws, ears, and tail, where colours tend to accumulate, and dry them thoroughly to prevent skin infections or fungal growth.<br>If your pet accidentally ingests coloured powder or water during the celebrations, monitor them closely for any signs of illness or discomfort. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, or difficulty breathing. Prompt medical attention is essential to ensure your pet's swift recovery and prevent any serious health complications.<br>Summing it up, <!-- -->Utpal Khot<!-- --> as a responsible Honorary Animal Welfare Representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India says:<br>(a) Remember to prioritise the safety and well-being of your furry friends. <br>(b) By opting for pet-safe colours, keeping them indoors during the festivities, protecting their eyes and skin, and maintaining proper hygiene, you can ensure that your pets enjoy a happy and healthy Holi experience. <br>(c) Let's celebrate this vibrant festival with love, compassion, and respect for all living beings, including our beloved pets.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">In the verdant landscapes of <!-- -->Wales<!-- -->, a remarkable discovery has emerged from the soil, shedding light on the intricate interplay of cultures during the Roman occupation of <!-- -->Britain<!-- -->.

The presence of the triskele, a motif consisting of three interlocking spirals, is emblematic of Iron Age Celtic designs. Its incorporation into Roman artifacts from the 2nd century AD provides a tangible example of how cultural influences merged during this era. One of the bracelets even features a square silver plate with a raised triskele decoration, further emphasizing this blend of artistic traditions.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108748505"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>These bracelets are not merely decorative items; they are historical artifacts that offer a window into the lives of those who inhabited <!-- -->Roman Britain<!-- -->.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">In the northern reaches of Brazil lies the island of Marajó, an ecological treasure where the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean. This island, roughly the size of Switzerland, is home to a unique policing method that has captured the world's attention. Here, the military police patrol the streets and fields not on horseback or in vehicles, but atop <!-- -->Asian water buffaloes<!-- -->.<div class=""persObserver personaliseWidgetLoader_108751126 elU3m iTamo undefined"" data-card=""readAlso"" data-heading="""" data-section=""Etimes"" data-subsection=""Trending"" id=""readAlso_108751126"" data-msid=""108751126"" data-template=""AS"" data-contentprimestatus=""non-prime"" data-userprimestatus=""non-prime"" style=""min-height:330.06px""></div><br>The Asian water buffalo, an animal endemic to India and Southeast Asia, has found an unlikely home on Marajó. Their journey to this <!-- -->Brazilian island<!-- --> is shrouded in mystery, with some believing they arrived from a shipwreck off the coast, while others claim they were brought over by prisoners escaping from French Guiana. Regardless of their origins, these buffaloes have thrived in Marajó's tropical climate, now numbering around half a million, surpassing the human population of 440,000.<br>These buffaloes are not merely a novelty; they are deeply integrated into the local culture and economy. They serve as work animals, dragging carriages through the streets of Soure, assisting farmers in the fields, and even participating in local festivals featuring buffalo races. Their presence is also felt in the culinary scene, with buffalo steaks and mozzarella gracing restaurant menus.<br>But perhaps the most striking role these creatures play is in law enforcement. The ""<!-- -->Buffalo Soldiers<!-- -->"" of Marajó, a term that nods to the 19th-century US army regiments and popularized by Bob Marley's reggae classic, are a unit of military police who ride buffaloes equipped with specially-adapted seats. This practice began out of necessity three decades ago when the flooded fields of Marajó made conventional patrolling methods impractical.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751126"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>The buffaloes' ability to navigate the muddy mangroves and flooded terrain during the rainy season gives them an advantage over horses and vehicles. They can reach speeds that other modes of transport cannot match in these conditions. However, mastering the control of a buffalo is a challenging task, requiring officers to undergo extensive training.<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

They carry on their backs not just the officers tasked with protecting the community but also the legacy of a place where nature and culture intertwine in the most unexpected ways.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">A <!-- -->lunar eclipse<!-- --> is a celestial event that occurs when the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/earth"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">Earth</a> comes between the Sun and the <a href=""https://www.speakingtree.in/topics/universe/moon"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">Moon</a>, casting a shadow on the Moon. This fascinating phenomenon has intrigued humans for millennia, and today, we understand the <!-- -->science<!-- --> behind it. In this article, we’ll explore the causes of a lunar eclipse and the science that explains how and why they occur.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""10""><h4>The alignment of Sun, Earth, and Moon and the lunar nodal cycle</h4></div><br>For a lunar eclipse to take place, the Sun, Earth, and Moon must be closely aligned in a straight line, an arrangement known as syzygy.<div class=""persObserver personaliseWidgetLoader_108750665 elU3m iTamo undefined"" data-card=""readAlso"" data-heading="""" data-section=""Etimes"" data-subsection=""Trending"" id=""readAlso_108750665"" data-msid=""108750665"" data-template=""AS"" data-contentprimestatus=""non-prime"" data-userprimestatus=""non-prime"" style=""min-height:330.06px""></div>This <!-- -->alignment<!-- --> happens only during a full moon when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. <br>However, despite the monthly occurrence of a full moon, we do not witness a lunar eclipse each time. The reason lies in the subtle tilt of the Moon’s orbital plane. The Moon’s path around the Earth is inclined at an angle of approximately 5.145° to the ecliptic plane—the apparent path that the Sun traces through the sky over the year. This inclination means that the Moon often passes slightly above or below the direct line between the Earth and the Sun, sparing it from the Earth’s shadow most months.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108750665"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>When the conditions do align, and the Moon skirts through the Earth’s shadow, the type and duration of the eclipse are further influenced by the proximity of the Moon to its nodes. The nodes are the two points where the Moon’s orbit intersects the ecliptic plane. A lunar eclipse can only occur when the full moon is near one of these nodes, allowing the Earth’s shadow to envelop the Moon. If the full moon occurs too far from these nodes, the alignment is not suitable for an eclipse, and the Moon remains brightly lit by the Sun’s unobstructed rays.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108750665""></div></div><br>The inclination of the Moon’s orbit is not a static figure but exhibits a slight oscillation over time, known as the lunar nodal cycle, which spans approximately 18.6 years. This cycle causes the conditions for eclipses to wax and wane, contributing to the varying frequency and type of lunar eclipses we observe from Earth. The interplay of these orbital mechanics ensures that each lunar eclipse is a unique event, with its own timing, duration, and visual characteristics.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""26""><h4>The Earth’s shadow <br></h4></div><br>The Earth’s shadow is a fundamental element in the occurrence of lunar eclipses, and understanding its two distinct parts—the <!-- -->umbra<!-- --> and the penumbra—is key to comprehending the different types of eclipses we observe. The umbra is the central, darkest portion of the shadow where the Earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. This area is where the most dramatic part of a lunar eclipse unfolds. When the Moon ventures into the umbra during an eclipse, it can lead to a partial or total eclipse, depending on how much of the Moon’s surface is obscured. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon is engulfed in the umbra, leading to the Moon’s complete immersion in shadow and often resulting in a striking, coppery-red coloration known as a “Blood Moon.”<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Source: Canva</div></div></div><br>Surrounding the umbra is the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/penumbra"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">penumbra</a>, a lighter shadow where the Sun’s light is only partially blocked by the Earth. This results in a subtle shading on the Moon’s surface rather than a full blackout. A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through this faint shadow, and the change in the Moon’s appearance is so slight that it can be difficult to detect without careful observation. The penumbral shadow’s effect is a gradient of darkness, with the deepest part closest to the umbra and gradually lightening as it stretches away. Penumbral eclipses are less spectacular than their umbral counterparts but are still an essential part of the trio of lunar eclipses, providing a delicate preamble or conclusion to the more noticeable phases of the eclipse<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""38""><h4>Types of Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>There are three types of lunar eclipses that one must know about: penumbral, partial, and total. A penumbral eclipse is the least noticeable, as the Moon only moves through the Earth’s penumbral shadow, causing a slight shading on the Moon’s surface. In a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon passes through the umbra, leading to a segment of the Moon appearing darkened. The most striking is the total lunar eclipse, where the entire Moon falls within the Earth’s umbral shadow, often acquiring a reddish hue due to the Earth’s atmosphere filtering and refracting sunlight.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""42""><h4>The role of Earth’s atmosphere</h4></div><br>During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon’s visibility and its reddish hue are indeed fascinating consequences of Earth’s atmosphere. As the Moon enters the Earth’s umbra, it is enveloped in a deep shadow, yet it does not become invisible. Instead, it glows with a reddish tint, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This occurs because the Earth’s atmosphere acts like a lens, refracting or bending the sunlight, especially the red wavelengths, towards the Moon. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter away, while the longer red wavelengths penetrate the atmosphere and reach the Moon. The specific shade of red can vary based on atmospheric conditions such as the amount of dust, ash, or clouds present. For instance, a volcanic eruption that releases fine particles into the atmosphere can result in a deeper red or even a darker eclipse. <br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""46""><h4>Observing Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>Lunar eclipses are unique in that they can be observed from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon during the eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses, which require protective eyewear, lunar eclipses can be safely viewed with the naked eye. These events provide not only a spectacular show but also an opportunity for scientific study, allowing astronomers to learn more about the Earth’s atmosphere and the astronomical mechanics of our planet and its natural satellite.<br><div class=""lOvcW""><div class=""ge4Md"" style=""min-height:290px""><div data-type=""in_view"" class=""loadable-inview  ""><div><span class=""UzraQ null""><span class=""aQKeu loadeblecomponentloader""></span></span></div></div></div><p class=""efT4r"">Trump Warns ‘Bloodbath’ if he is not elected, Biden Slams with ‘Loser to Get Another Electoral Defeat’</p></div><br></div>"

His breakfast often comes from McDonald's, and he is known to have used borrowed furniture when his children were young. His hobbies include playing bridge, golfing, and strumming on one of his 22 ukuleles, a skill he used to charm his first wife, Susan.<br>The bulk of Buffett's wealth is tied to Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that has amassed over $1 trillion in assets.

Surgeons may perform procedures such as tumor resection, lymph node dissection, or organ removal to remove cancerous tissues and prevent the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Advancements in surgical techniques, such as minimally invasive procedures and robotic-assisted surgery, have improved outcomes and reduced recovery times for many cancer patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">Holi, the festival of colours, is a joyous occasion celebrated by millions across the globe. However, amidst all the vibrant hues and festivities, it's essential to ensure the safety and well-being of our <!-- -->furry companions<!-- -->. As pet owners, it's our responsibility to celebrate Holi in a manner that keeps our pets safe from harm. In this article, we'll explore how you can enjoy a <!-- -->pet-friendly Holi<!-- --> while safeguarding your beloved animals from toxic colours and other potential hazards. Let us also look at basic suggestions and guidelines given by the <!-- -->Animal Welfare Board of India<!-- --> for Animal safety.<br><span class=""strong "">Tips to ensure </span><span class=""strong "">pet safety</span><span class=""strong ""> during Holi:</span><br>1. Opt for <!-- -->pet-safe colours<br>When planning your <!-- -->Holi celebrations<!-- -->, make sure to choose pet-friendly colours that are non-toxic and safe for animals. Avoid using traditional synthetic colours that contain harmful chemicals like lead, mercury, and arsenic, which can be extremely harmful if ingested by your pets. Instead, opt for natural and organic colours made from ingredients such as turmeric, beetroot, and spinach, which are not only safe but also eco-friendly.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751140"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>Additionally, you can create DIY pet-safe colours at home using ingredients readily available in your kitchen. For example, turmeric mixed with flour can create a vibrant yellow colour, while beetroot juice diluted with water can produce a lovely shade of pink. Get creative and experiment with different natural ingredients to make colourful powders and water-based paints that are safe for your pets to play with.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108751140""></div></div><br>2. Keep your pets indoors<br>On the day of Holi, it's advisable to keep your pets indoors to protect them from the chaos and commotion associated with the festivities. Loud noises, crowded streets, and unfamiliar faces can cause stress and anxiety in animals, leading to undesirable behaviour or even accidents. Create a safe and comfortable space for your pets inside your home, away from the hustle and bustle of the celebrations, where they can feel secure and relaxed.<br>If you have outdoor pets such as dogs or cats, consider bringing them indoors a day before and after Holi to minimize their exposure to coloured powders and water. Provide them with plenty of food, water, and toys to keep them entertained while they wait out the festivities indoors. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your pet's well-being.<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Protect your pet's eyes and skin<br>If you decide to include your pets in the Holi celebrations, take extra precautions to shield their eyes and skin from coloured powders and water. Consider dressing your pets in lightweight clothing or applying a coat of pet-safe sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful UV rays and colour stains. Additionally, use protective eyewear or pet goggles to prevent coloured powder from getting into their eyes, which can cause irritation or infection.<br>Keep a close eye on your pets during the celebrations and intervene immediately if you notice any signs of discomfort or distress. Provide them with plenty of fresh water to drink and a shady spot to rest if they become overheated or tired. Remember, your pets rely on you to keep them safe, so be vigilant and proactive in ensuring their well-being during Holi.<br>4. Maintain hygiene and cleanliness<br>After the festivities are over, it's essential to thoroughly clean and groom your pets to remove any traces of coloured powders or chemicals from their fur and skin. Use mild pet shampoo and lukewarm water to gently wash away the colours, taking care not to scrub too vigorously, as it may irritate their sensitive skin. Pay special attention to their paws, ears, and tail, where colours tend to accumulate, and dry them thoroughly to prevent skin infections or fungal growth.<br>If your pet accidentally ingests coloured powder or water during the celebrations, monitor them closely for any signs of illness or discomfort. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, lethargy, or difficulty breathing. Prompt medical attention is essential to ensure your pet's swift recovery and prevent any serious health complications.<br>Summing it up, <!-- -->Utpal Khot<!-- --> as a responsible Honorary Animal Welfare Representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India says:<br>(a) Remember to prioritise the safety and well-being of your furry friends. <br>(b) By opting for pet-safe colours, keeping them indoors during the festivities, protecting their eyes and skin, and maintaining proper hygiene, you can ensure that your pets enjoy a happy and healthy Holi experience. <br>(c) Let's celebrate this vibrant festival with love, compassion, and respect for all living beings, including our beloved pets.

"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">A <!-- -->lunar eclipse<!-- --> is a celestial event that occurs when the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/earth"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">Earth</a> comes between the Sun and the <a href=""https://www.speakingtree.in/topics/universe/moon"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" rel=""noopener nofollow noreferrer"" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">Moon</a>, casting a shadow on the Moon. This fascinating phenomenon has intrigued humans for millennia, and today, we understand the <!-- -->science<!-- --> behind it. In this article, we’ll explore the causes of a lunar eclipse and the science that explains how and why they occur.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""10""><h4>The alignment of Sun, Earth, and Moon and the lunar nodal cycle</h4></div><br>For a lunar eclipse to take place, the Sun, Earth, and Moon must be closely aligned in a straight line, an arrangement known as syzygy.<div class=""persObserver personaliseWidgetLoader_108750665 elU3m iTamo undefined"" data-card=""readAlso"" data-heading="""" data-section=""Etimes"" data-subsection=""Trending"" id=""readAlso_108750665"" data-msid=""108750665"" data-template=""AS"" data-contentprimestatus=""non-prime"" data-userprimestatus=""non-prime"" style=""min-height:330.06px""></div>This <!-- -->alignment<!-- --> happens only during a full moon when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun. <br>However, despite the monthly occurrence of a full moon, we do not witness a lunar eclipse each time. The reason lies in the subtle tilt of the Moon’s orbital plane. The Moon’s path around the Earth is inclined at an angle of approximately 5.145° to the ecliptic plane—the apparent path that the Sun traces through the sky over the year. This inclination means that the Moon often passes slightly above or below the direct line between the Earth and the Sun, sparing it from the Earth’s shadow most months.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108750665"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>When the conditions do align, and the Moon skirts through the Earth’s shadow, the type and duration of the eclipse are further influenced by the proximity of the Moon to its nodes. The nodes are the two points where the Moon’s orbit intersects the ecliptic plane. A lunar eclipse can only occur when the full moon is near one of these nodes, allowing the Earth’s shadow to envelop the Moon. If the full moon occurs too far from these nodes, the alignment is not suitable for an eclipse, and the Moon remains brightly lit by the Sun’s unobstructed rays.<div class=""mgid_country_osv_parent""><div id=""650c3bbfb55d271dc576e9c4-osv-mrec-108750665""></div></div><br>The inclination of the Moon’s orbit is not a static figure but exhibits a slight oscillation over time, known as the lunar nodal cycle, which spans approximately 18.6 years. This cycle causes the conditions for eclipses to wax and wane, contributing to the varying frequency and type of lunar eclipses we observe from Earth. The interplay of these orbital mechanics ensures that each lunar eclipse is a unique event, with its own timing, duration, and visual characteristics.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""26""><h4>The Earth’s shadow <br></h4></div><br>The Earth’s shadow is a fundamental element in the occurrence of lunar eclipses, and understanding its two distinct parts—the <!-- -->umbra<!-- --> and the penumbra—is key to comprehending the different types of eclipses we observe. The umbra is the central, darkest portion of the shadow where the Earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. This area is where the most dramatic part of a lunar eclipse unfolds. When the Moon ventures into the umbra during an eclipse, it can lead to a partial or total eclipse, depending on how much of the Moon’s surface is obscured. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon is engulfed in the umbra, leading to the Moon’s complete immersion in shadow and often resulting in a striking, coppery-red coloration known as a “Blood Moon.”<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Source: Canva</div></div></div><br>Surrounding the umbra is the <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/penumbra"" styleobj=""[object Object]"" class="""" target="""" frmappuse=""1"">penumbra</a>, a lighter shadow where the Sun’s light is only partially blocked by the Earth. This results in a subtle shading on the Moon’s surface rather than a full blackout. A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through this faint shadow, and the change in the Moon’s appearance is so slight that it can be difficult to detect without careful observation. The penumbral shadow’s effect is a gradient of darkness, with the deepest part closest to the umbra and gradually lightening as it stretches away. Penumbral eclipses are less spectacular than their umbral counterparts but are still an essential part of the trio of lunar eclipses, providing a delicate preamble or conclusion to the more noticeable phases of the eclipse<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""38""><h4>Types of Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>There are three types of lunar eclipses that one must know about: penumbral, partial, and total. A penumbral eclipse is the least noticeable, as the Moon only moves through the Earth’s penumbral shadow, causing a slight shading on the Moon’s surface. In a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon passes through the umbra, leading to a segment of the Moon appearing darkened. The most striking is the total lunar eclipse, where the entire Moon falls within the Earth’s umbral shadow, often acquiring a reddish hue due to the Earth’s atmosphere filtering and refracting sunlight.<br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""42""><h4>The role of Earth’s atmosphere</h4></div><br>During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon’s visibility and its reddish hue are indeed fascinating consequences of Earth’s atmosphere. As the Moon enters the Earth’s umbra, it is enveloped in a deep shadow, yet it does not become invisible. Instead, it glows with a reddish tint, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This occurs because the Earth’s atmosphere acts like a lens, refracting or bending the sunlight, especially the red wavelengths, towards the Moon. Shorter blue wavelengths scatter away, while the longer red wavelengths penetrate the atmosphere and reach the Moon. The specific shade of red can vary based on atmospheric conditions such as the amount of dust, ash, or clouds present. For instance, a volcanic eruption that releases fine particles into the atmosphere can result in a deeper red or even a darker eclipse. <br><div class=""cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component "" data-pos=""46""><h4>Observing Lunar Eclipses <br></h4></div><br>Lunar eclipses are unique in that they can be observed from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon during the eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses, which require protective eyewear, lunar eclipses can be safely viewed with the naked eye. These events provide not only a spectacular show but also an opportunity for scientific study, allowing astronomers to learn more about the Earth’s atmosphere and the astronomical mechanics of our planet and its natural satellite.<br><div class=""lOvcW""><div class=""ge4Md"" style=""min-height:290px""><div data-type=""in_view"" class=""loadable-inview  ""><div><span class=""UzraQ null""><span class=""aQKeu loadeblecomponentloader""></span></span></div></div></div><p class=""efT4r"">Trump Warns ‘Bloodbath’ if he is not elected, Biden Slams with ‘Loser to Get Another Electoral Defeat’</p></div><br></div>"
"<div class=""_s30J clearfix  "">In the northern reaches of Brazil lies the island of Marajó, an ecological treasure where the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean. This island, roughly the size of Switzerland, is home to a unique policing method that has captured the world's attention.

Their journey to this <!-- -->Brazilian island<!-- --> is shrouded in mystery, with some believing they arrived from a shipwreck off the coast, while others claim they were brought over by prisoners escaping from French Guiana. Regardless of their origins, these buffaloes have thrived in Marajó's tropical climate, now numbering around half a million, surpassing the human population of 440,000.<br>These buffaloes are not merely a novelty; they are deeply integrated into the local culture and economy. They serve as work animals, dragging carriages through the streets of Soure, assisting farmers in the fields, and even participating in local festivals featuring buffalo races. Their presence is also felt in the culinary scene, with buffalo steaks and mozzarella gracing restaurant menus.<br>But perhaps the most striking role these creatures play is in law enforcement. The ""<!-- -->Buffalo Soldiers<!-- -->"" of Marajó, a term that nods to the 19th-century US army regiments and popularized by Bob Marley's reggae classic, are a unit of military police who ride buffaloes equipped with specially-adapted seats. This practice began out of necessity three decades ago when the flooded fields of Marajó made conventional patrolling methods impractical.<br><div class=""mgid_second_mrec_parent""><div class=""wdt-taboola"" data-mode=""thumbnails-mid"" data-target_type=""mix"" style=""max-height:415px;overflow:hidden"" id=""taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-108751126"" data-placement=""Mid Article Thumbnails 1""></div></div>The buffaloes' ability to navigate the muddy mangroves and flooded terrain during the rainy season gives them an advantage over horses and vehicles. They can reach speeds that other modes of transport cannot match in these conditions. However, mastering the control of a buffalo is a challenging task, requiring officers to undergo extensive training.<br><div data-pos=""0"" class=""id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Despite being one of the world's richest individuals, Buffett maintains a lifestyle that contradicts his immense wealth.<br>As per an Inside report, Buffett continues to reside in the same Omaha home he purchased in the 1950s and drives vehicles that are far from luxurious. His breakfast often comes from McDonald's, and he is known to have used borrowed furniture when his children were young. His hobbies include playing bridge, golfing, and strumming on one of his 22 ukuleles, a skill he used to charm his first wife, Susan.<br>The bulk of Buffett's wealth is tied to Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that has amassed over $1 trillion in assets. His journey to riches began at an early age, investing in stocks at 11 and filing taxes by 13. Despite his fortune, the majority of his wealth was accumulated after his 50th birthday, with his annual salary from Berkshire Hathaway remaining at $100,000 for the last 40 years, the Insider report said.<br>Although Buffett has had his share of investment missteps, such as a Sinclair gas station, these have been vastly outweighed by his successes.

He once expressed at a shareholder meeting, ""There are things money can't buy... My life couldn't be happier. In fact, it'd be worse if I had six or eight houses.
