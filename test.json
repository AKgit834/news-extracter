{"data": ["NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday dropped Sanjay Nirupam from the list of star campaigners in Maharashtra and announced that action will be taken against him for his remarks against the party. \"The way he has been making remarks, it seems he has taken a contract to speak against the party. Action will be taken against him in a day or two. No notice will be sent to him,\" Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said.Nirupam responded to the news with a dig at the Congress and said he will announce his future course of action tomorrow. \"Congress should not waste its energy and stationery on me and instead use whatever little is left in saving the party. It is anyways going through a huge economic crisis. My one-week deadline ends today and I will make an announcement tomorrow,\" he said in a post on X.Action against Sanjay Nirupam comes amid reports that he may be on his way out of the party. Nirupam has openly opposed Congress's alliance with Shiv Sena (UBT) in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The former Mumbai Congress chief had said the Congress should not allow itself to be arm-twisted by Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit after Shiv Sena (UBT) unilaterally announced 17 candidates. \"Shiv Sena (UBT) arm-twisted the Congress to take five of the six seats in Mumbai. But the Congress should not allow itself to be arm-twisted like this. This action is against the Congress and it's a ploy to finish off the party in the city,\" the Congress leader had said.Nirupam, who had lost Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai northwest in 2019, had given the party leadership a week's time to decide and had said that \"all options were open for him.\"The Maharashtra Congress had objected to the Shiv Sena (UBT) announcing its candidates for the Bhiwandi, Mumbai South Central and Sangli Lok Sabha seats, saying MVA partners must stick to \"coalition dharma\".

A glaring instance from the IPL 2024 season is the underwhelming display of Glenn Maxwell, whose contributions failed to meet team's expectations.RCB have lost three out of their four IPL games this season with Maxwell only contributing only 31 runs so far in four innings.Skipper Faf du Plessis also failed to make any impact managing just 65 runs in four games.IPL 2024 Points Table | IPL 2024 ScheduleFormer India cricketer Manoj Tiwary didn't hold back in criticizing Maxwell for his disappointing performances. Drawing a comparison with Anuj Rawat, Tiwary pointed out that while Rawat's struggles can be understood as he is an emerging cricketer, the consistent underperformance of established players like Maxwell is perplexing.\"RCB ko hamesha dekha gaya hai ki ek batting-heavy team hai lekin iss samay na ballebaaz run bana rahe hain aur na bowlers ubhar kar aa rahe hain. Aur aap dekhein middle-order mein Anuj Rawat, phele match itni badiya performance rahi thi unki lekin temperament wise vo innings ko pace nahi kar paa rahe hain.(RCB have always been considered a batting-heavy team but their line-up has failed to deliver. Neither their batters are getting runs nor their bowlers are performing good. In the middle order, batter like Anuj Rawat has not put up a good show after playing a good knock in the first match,\") Tiwary told Cricbuzz.\"Samjh sakte hain ki ubharte hue khilaadi hain lekin aise situations mein itne bade bade khilaadiyon ke saath waqt bitaane ke baad bhi agar aap nahi seekh paa rahe ho, toh iska matlab ki dhyaan kaheen aur jaa raha hai. Khaas kar bade ballebaazon ko jab team retain karti hain, jaise ki Glenn Maxwell, salary toh inki time to time aa jaati hai lekin performance nahi aati hai. (I understand that you are a young player but you are also surrounded by some of the top players in your team. If you can't get that clarity to how to go about the game, then I think you are not focused. Well, I would say that management is also showing so much faith in Maxwell by retaining him but he is only getting paid from time to time and not giving a match-winning performance for the team,\") he added.", "Income tax rules for FY 2024-25: As the financial year 2024-25 has begun on April 1, it is important to be aware of income tax rules. Even if changes are announced in the Union Budget or during the year, they usually take effect from the start of the new financial year. This year, there were no changes announced for FY 2024-25 in the interim budget, so the income tax rules from the previous year remain unchanged.Here are the six income tax rules that will apply from April 1, 2024: 1. Choosing between old and new income tax regimesFor TDS (tax deducted at source) on salary, employees must select between the old and new tax regimes, states an ET report.The default option is the new tax regime. If you don't inform your employer about opting for the old tax regime, they will deduct tax based on the new regime from your salary. Make sure to do this promptly when requested by your employer.2. Basic exemption limitsThere's a difference in the basic exemption limit between the old and new tax regimes. If an individual's income doesn't exceed this limit in a financial year, they don't have to pay tax. Currently, under the new tax regime, income up to Rs 3 lakh is tax-exempt for all individuals, regardless of age. In the old tax regime, the exemption limit varies with age. For individuals below 60 years, Rs 2.5 lakh is exempt from tax, for seniors aged 60 to 80 years, it's Rs 3 lakh, and for super senior citizens aged 80 years and above, it's Rs 5 lakh.Income tax slabs under new tax regimeIncome range (In Rs)Income tax rate (%)0-3,00,00003,00,001-6,00,00056,00,001-9,00,000109,00,001-12,00,0001512,00,001-15,00,0002015,00,001 and above30Income tax slabs under old tax regimeIncome range (In Rs)Income tax rate (%)0-2,50,00002,50,001-5,00,00055,00,001-10,00,0002010,00,001 and above303. Tax rebatesIncome tax laws provide a tax rebate to resident individuals in both tax regimes. This rebate, available under Section 87A, does away with the need to pay tax if the net taxable income stays below a certain limit.The new tax regime offers a higher rebate compared to the old one. Under the new regime, individuals can get a rebate of up to Rs 25,000, making incomes up to Rs 7 lakh tax-free. In contrast, the old tax regime offers a rebate of up to Rs 12,500, making incomes up to Rs 5 lakh tax-free.4. Deductions and exemptions: New vs old regimeBoth tax regimes provide deductions and exemptions, but the old regime offers more. Examples of deductions and exemptions available under the old tax regime include standard deduction, Section 80C for investments and expenses up to Rs 1.5 lakh, Section 80D for health insurance premiums, and Section 80CCD (1B) for additional NPS investment up to Rs 50,000. Additionally, deductions can be claimed for home loan interest up to Rs 2 lakh, education loan interest, and charitable donations. Moreover, individuals can also claim exemptions for house rent allowance (HRA) and leave travel allowance (LTA).The new tax regime provides only two deductions for individuals. These include a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 from salary and pension income, and a deduction under Section 80CCD (2) for the employer's contribution to the NPS account. Family pensioners are also eligible for a standard deduction of Rs 15,000 under the new tax regime. It's worth noting that these deductions are also available under the old tax regime.Claiming eligible deductions, depending on the chosen tax regime, allows individuals to decrease their net taxable income and tax liability.5. Filing Income Tax Returns (ITR)If you intend to choose the old tax regime when filing your income tax return this year, make sure to file your ITR before the July 31 deadline. This is crucial because the new tax regime is the default option, and income tax rules permit individuals to select the old tax regime only if their ITR is filed on time. If you file a belated ITR between August 1 and December 31, your tax liability will be calculated based solely on the new tax regime.6. Surcharge ratesA high-income earner choosing the new tax regime will face a lower surcharge rate. For incomes exceeding Rs 5 crore, the rate has been reduced from 37% to 25% under the new tax regime. However, if the individual selects the old tax regime, a surcharge rate of 37% will apply.", "NEW DELHI: Elon Musk CEO of Tesla and owner of X (previously known as Twitter) expressed his intent to purchase shares of Disney (DIS) if activist investor Nelson Peltz secures a seat on the media and entertainment giant\u2019s board. Musk's statement came on Wednesday, endorsing Peltz's potential influence on Disney's board. \"Nelson Peltz should definitely be on the Disney board! He would help reform the company, improve the quality of product and generally serve in the best interests of shareholders, as he has done at many other companies,\" Musk conveyed via X platform.He further added, \"This would significantly improve Disney\u2019s share price.\"Musk's remarks were prompted by a post from American hedge fund manager Bill Ackman on X, expressing concerns over alleged leaks to the media about Disney's proxy contest results against Nelson Peltz. Ackman emphasised the inappropriate nature of such actions, stating they could unfairly influence the voting outcome. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Disney has garnered adequate shareholder support to overcome a board challenge from Peltz's Trian Fund Management. The vote count allegedly showed Disney's board members maintaining a comfortable lead over Trian's nominees, including Peltz himself and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.In response to the circulating rumors, Ackman urged DIS shareholders to cast their votes in favor of Peltz\u2019s election to the board. He cautioned against potential manipulation of shareholder behavior through early election result leaks, which could favor the incumbent board. \"Based on my knowledge of Nelson's capabilities and the dirty tricks implemented by the company and its advisors, I strongly recommend that shareholders vote for Nelson Peltz for the Disney board,\" Ackman asserted.Musk highlighted that Peltz's election to the board would make Disney stock more attractive for investment. \"While I don\u2019t own any Disney shares today, I would definitely buy their shares if Nelson were elected to the board. His track record is excellent,\" Musk stated, signaling his confidence in Peltz's potential impact on Disney's future direction.", "The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has reportedly issued a directive to all e-commerce companies, emphasizing accurate labeling for certain beverage categories. According to a report in Economic Times, FSSAI speifically advises against referring to dairy-based, cereal-based, or malt-based beverages as \u201chealth drinks\u201d or \u201cenergy drinks.\u201dWhat is the reason behind this directiveThe rationale behind this directive lies in the absence of a clear definition for the term \u201chealth drink\u201d within the country\u2019s food laws.Additionally, the term \u201cenergy drink\u201d is specifically reserved for carbonated and non-carbonated water-based flavored beverages under existing regulations.Recognizing that incorrect terminology can be misleading for consumers, FSSAI urges e-commerce Food Business Operators (FBOs) to promptly rectify any misclassification. They should remove or de-link such beverages from the category of \u201cHealth Drinks / Energy Drinks.\u201dFSSAI clarifies that the term \u201cHealth Drink\u201d lacks standardization within the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006 and related rules and regulations governing the food industry. On the other hand, the use of \u201cEnergy Drinks\u201d is permissible only for products falling within the specified criteria.In a bid to enhance clarity and transparency, FSSAI aims to ensure that consumers can make well-informed choices without encountering misleading information. Notably, companies like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Hell offer energy drinks at a fraction of the price charged by global category leaders such as Red Bull and Monster. These affordable options have gained popularity and are now widely available in grocery stores. However, the rising consumption of energy drinks, particularly among young people, raises concerns due to potential health impacts associated with excessive intake.", "NEW DELHI: Former India batter Ambati Rayudu suggests that Royal Challengers Bengaluru's inability to secure an IPL title stems from the consistent underperformance of highly-paid international stars, leaving the burden on junior players.Rayudu, a multiple-time IPL champion with Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings, refrains from naming individuals but hints at the trio of Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell, and Faf du Plessis.In the ongoing IPL season, RCB has lost two out of three matches. Despite Kohli's 203 runs at a strike-rate exceeding 140, his performances in the Powerplay have been lackluster.Du Plessis has mustered only 65 runs across four games, while Maxwell's contribution stands at a mere 31 runs in as many matches.\"RCB's bowlers always concede over par runs and their batting unit performs under par,\" Rayudu told Star Sports after RCB lost to LSG on Tuesday.\"Who are all batting in pressure situations? The young Indian batters and Dinesh Karthik. The big international names, who are supposed to take the pressure, where are they? All are back in the dressing room,\" Rayudu said.IPL 2024 Points Table | IPL 2024 ScheduleHe was referring to Mahipal Lomror, who has come in as Impact Sub in a few games and scored at a strike-rate of 230 plus and Karthik, whose cameo was instrumental in their only win of the season so far against Punjab Kings.Rayudu termed it as a convenient option for senior batters, who are consuming all the Powerplay overs, where scoring runs is easy with field restrictions in place.\"Sixteen years. This is the same story of RCB, when there is pressure, no big name is ever found standing. All youngsters are playing at the back-end and all the big guns bat at the top of the order and they whip off the cream from the cake and that is the reason this team has never won IPL,\" said the 38-year-old firebrand batter, who played 55 ODIs and six T20Is for India between 2013 and 2019.(With PTI inputs)", "It's always a guilty pleasure to be an enthusiastic spectator spotting celebs at the airport, on the red carpet, or at gala events where the glitterati casually hang out.

The finding published in the 2014 scientific paper titled 'Dehydration melting at the top of the lower mantle,' has reignited curiosity about the mysteries lurking within our planet.The oceanic reservoir, within a mineral known as ringwoodite, surpasses the combined volume of all surface oceans thrice over, presenting a challenge to our understanding of Earth's water origins.Geophysicist Steve Jacobsen, in the discovery team, sheds light on the unique properties of ringwoodite, describing it as a \"sponge\" with an unparalleled capacity to trap water deep within the Earth.Jacobsen said, \"I think we are finally seeing evidence for a whole-Earth water cycle, which may help explain the vast amount of liquid water on the surface of our habitable planet. Scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades.\"The breakthrough came after the analysis of seismic activity, with seismometers detecting shockwaves reverberating beneath the Earth's surface. By scrutinizing seismic data from over 500 earthquakes using a network of 2000 seismographs across the United States, researchers discerned a discernible slowing of seismic waves passing through hydrated rock, indicative of the presence of this expansive subterranean water reserve.\"The high water storage capacity of minerals in Earth's mantle transition zone (410- to 660-kilometer depth) implies the possibility of a deep H2O reservoir, which could cause dehydration and melting of vertically flowing mantle. We examined the effects of downwelling from the transition zone into the lower mantle with high-pressure laboratory experiments, numerical modelling, and seismic P-to-S conversions,\" said the scientists.\"This is substantial evidence that water on Earth came from within,\" Jacobsen asserts, underscoring the paradigm-shifting implications of the discovery.Furthermore, the findings challenge conventional theories regarding the origins of Earth's water, suggesting that it may have originated from within the planet rather than arriving via comet impacts, as previously proposed. This revelation not only captivates with its sheer magnitude but also offers a fresh perspective on Earth's water cycle, proposing that water may seep from the planet's core, gradually shaping the surface we inhabit.The implications extend beyond mere scientific curiosity, as Jacobsen highlights the significance of this reservoir in sustaining terrestrial ecosystems. Without this concealed water source, Earth's surface would be devoid of the life-sustaining liquid, fundamentally altering the planet's landscape as we know it.", "BAREILLY: Police have booked gangster Sameer Khan alias Raka for allegedly circulating photos from high-security barrack of the Bareilly Central Jail.An FIR was lodged in the matter at Izzatnagar police station in Bareilly on Monday.

He sees the young fast bowler as a \"potential pick\" for India's squad in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Hailing from Delhi and aged just 21, Mayank Yadav has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed with each match he plays.His recent thunderbolt clocked at 156.7 kmph against Royal Challengers Bangalore exemplifies his rapid progress. This performance marked his second consecutive man-of-the-match display in his debut season, steering Lucknow Super Giants to a resounding victory.Rabada himself experienced Mayank's ferocity firsthand when Punjab Kings faced Lucknow Super Giants last week. Mayank's barrage of short-pitched deliveries proved formidable as he claimed three wickets with his blistering pace. Rabada, widely regarded as one of the premier pacers in the sport, also commended Mayank's remarkable accuracy.\"He has got something that you cannot buy and that is raw pace. That is exactly what he is exploiting and exploiting it extremely well,\" Rabada told PTI in an interview.\"The lengths that he hits, his plan is clear and now batters are going to be aware of what he can bring to the party but it is pretty obvious he has got immense pace and it seems he can control where he wants to bowl.\"When you have got pace and control as well, and he understands his role.

To my understanding, he will definitely be looked at as a potential pick.\"'Available for each and every game this IPL'The IPL 2024 holds heightened significance as it serves as a crucial precursor to the T20 World Cup in June, where Rabada aims to contribute to South Africa's quest for an elusive ICC title.However, Rabada maintains unwavering dedication to Punjab Kings' campaign for the current season, prioritizing his responsibilities with the franchise before the international stage.\"My goal is to play each and every game and to make myself available for each and every game this IPL. The rest is up to the coach and management.\"Leading up to the World Cup, if picked, it is something that I would love to be involved in. The IPL would definitely be a test to see where you are at and and see where you can be a bit better and brush up. At the same time, it is about trying to win games for the Punjab Kings.\"Rabada's hunger for titles burns brightly, with aspirations of securing both South Africa's elusive ICC trophy and an IPL championship within the next three months. While Delhi Capitals came close to clinching the IPL title in 2020, Rabada remains determined to achieve a trophy double.In contrast to his South African teammate Quinton de Kock's divisive opinion, who touted the IPL as the pinnacle of his career achievements after triumphing with Mumbai Indians, Rabada stops short of such a declaration. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the IPL's unparalleled significance in the realm of franchise cricket, considering it the foremost prize in the global cricketing arena.\"The IPL is the biggest T20 league in the world barring the ICC events. It seems to be a league that is growing from strength to strength, attracting the world's best players\"He (de Kock) is right in saying it...IPL is definitely the best out there. I still think the country takes precedence over any sort of league you play.'\"However, winning the IPL would be monstrous and would be a huge achievement and a tick off the bucket list.

While Indira with the slogan of \u2018Garibi Hatao\u2019 managed to win across India, she was accused of election malpractice a few years later.\u27a4 That Karnataka, unlike its neighbours Andhra and Tamil Nadu, has failed in building a strong regional party (or parties) that could have made an impact nationally is no secret. But the reason no national party \u2014 Congress, Janata Party, or even BJP \u2014 has managed to sweep elections is also because the state has seen consistent efforts by functionaries to build either regional parties or alternatives to national parties.", "Phones under Rs. 10,000 can offer substantial benefits for both middle-class buyers and rugged users.

Singh confidently proclaimed that the people's support would render the opposition powerless in the polls.In a nod to the viral 'moye moye' trend originating from a Serbian song, Singh injected a touch of humor into his speech and said, \"desh ki janta moye moye kar degi\" (the people will make the Opposition come a cropper in the elections).The trend, which gained popularity on social media platforms, added a lighthearted tone to his remarks.The hit song 'Moye More', was officially released by the name of 'Dzanum', by Serbian singer-songwriter Teya Dora. The lyrics of the song hint at anguish, despair and nightmares. However, in India, netizens set the song along with their hilarious Instagram reels and memes on other social media platforms.Singh said the fragmented nature of the opposition alliance, dismisses it as a coalition of convenience among self-serving leaders. He emphasized that despite their unity, the opposition bloc would falter against the formidable NDA.\"Several Opposition parties came together to fight and defeat the BJP. However, you can all see that this is an alliance of convenience of some self-seeking Opposition leaders. However, they can't even face up to the NDA even if they are united. Iss desh ki janata iska bhi moye moye kar degi (the people will make the Opposition come a cropper in the elections),\" the minister said.The defence minister also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's diplomatic prowess, specifically citing the successful repatriation of 22,500 Indian students stranded in Ukraine. He commended PM Modi for elevating India's global standing since assuming office in 2014, emphasizing the nation's newfound influence on the international stage.Singh reiterated the pride of the nation in PM Modi's leadership, highlighting the unprecedented ceasefire orchestrated to evacuate Indian citizens from the conflict in Ukraine.\"The India of today is a powerful country. The world did not take us seriously earlier, but PM Modi worked a miracle to get us where he has. Today, when India speaks on a global forum, the whole world listens. This is a ringing endorsement and affirmation of where our country is today,\" the Raksha Mantri said.\"We should all be proud of how the war (between Russia and Ukraine) was stopped for four-and-a-half hours to enable the passage of 22,500 Indian children from Ukraine. This is India,\" he said.The BJP's endorsement of Atul Garg as its candidate for the Ghaziabad constituency further solidified their campaign efforts. Garg, a current member of the state legislative assembly from Ghaziabad, has garnered support from the party after Union Minister Gen (retd) VK Singh withdrew from the electoral race.Ghaziabad, set to vote on April 26 in the second phase of elections, holds significant electoral weight with over 29 lakh registered voters across five assembly areas.Spread across five assembly areas of Loni, Muradnagar, Sahibabad, Ghaziabad and Dhaulana (Hapur), the Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency has over 29 lakh registered voters, according to officials.(With inputs from agencies)", "NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday filed his nomination papers for the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala for the upcoming elections. Rahul was accompanied by his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and a large number of party workers and supporters.Addressing a public gathering ahead of filing his nomination papers, Rahul Gandhi said that he treats people of Wayanad as he treats his younger sister Priyanka Gandhi.\"It has been an honour for me to be your member of Parliament. I don't treat you and think of you like an electorate. I treat you and think of you the same way I think of my little sister Priyanka. So in the houses of Wayanad, I have sisters, mothers, fathers and brothers. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for that,\" Rahul said.He also said that he was always ready to bring the issues being faced by the people of the constituency to the attention of the nation and the world.\"There is an issue of man-animal conflict, medical college issue. I stand with the people of Wayanad in this fight. We have tried to pressurise the government on the medical college, I have written letters to the CM. But unfortunately, they have not moved forward. I am absolutely convinced that if we have a government in Delhi and when we get a government in Kerala, both of which we will do, we will resolve these issues,\" the Congress leader said.\"I am not making just a political speech. Regardless of the parties, communities, age, every single person in Wayanad gave me love, affection, respect and treated me as their own,\" he added.Earlier, Rahul held a road show through his constituency and interacted with the people. The former Congress president had won from Wayanad in the 2019 Parliament polls with a massive margin of over four lakh votes.The Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate Annie Raja also filed her nomination for Wayanad against the Congress party's sitting MP Rahul Gandhi.(With inputs from agencies)", "NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has lost 4.5kg weight since his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate, AAP sources claimed on Wednesday.Party sources claimed that doctors in Tihar Jail have expressed their concern over the sudden weight loss of the AAP national convener. Kejriwal is a diabetic and takes regular medicines to control his blood sugar level.However, Tihar Jail authorities have released a statement stating that the Delhi CM is fine.\"On arrival on 01.04.2024, Arvind Kejriwal was examined by two doctors and all his vitals were normal. Also, his weight has constant at 65kg, since his arrival in jail and to date. Home-cooked food is being provided as per the court order. His vital statistics are also normal,\" the statement read.Arrested in a money laundering case related to the now-withdrawn Delhi excise policy on March 21, Kejriwal is currently lodged in Tihar's Jail No.2. He was sent to judicial custody for 15 days on April 1. His petition for interim bail is likely to be heard today.A senior AAP functionary said Delhi CM's blood sugar level has been fluctuating over the past few days and had touched 50 when he was in ED's custody last week.Kejriwal's health is regularly monitored by a nurse in the jail who gives him his medicines at fixed timings. The AAP leader is served home-cooked food inside the jail.With inputs from agencies", "According to a recent ICMR-INDIAB study, the number of people living with diabetes has increased by 44% between 2019 and 2023 to over 101 million1. While managing a chronic condition like diabetes can be challenging, people can take a holistic approach to keep their glucose levels in check by modifying their lifestyle, exercising regularly, eating well, and monitoring their glucose levels.Tracking one\u2019s blood sugar levels informs personalised lifestyle and care decisions. This has been made simpler with technology advancements like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Access to powerful data can help people optimise their glucose control and lower their risk of other health complications. Dr Prashanth Subramanian, Head of Medical Affairs, Emerging Asia & India, Diabetes Care, Abbott, shares, \u201cCGM helps people monitor their glucose levels real-time without hassles, complementing traditional blood glucose monitoring devices which require routine finger pricking. It shares valuable, actionable insights and is supported by a digital ecosystem that makes connecting with doctors and caregivers easy. The device also offers a unique metric: the time people spend in the target glucose range. Knowing this data can be life-changing and help people make smarter health decisions and gear for better glucose control.\u201d Illustrating the device\u2019s real-world impact, it has been found that when people with type 2 diabetes on insulin used CGM, it was associated with substantial reductions in acute diabetes events (by 51%) and hospitalisations (by 28%)2. With metrics like time in range (TIR), people can adjust their diet, activity, and treatment to better manage their diabetes, which in turn can help them avoid or manage other comorbid conditions. Every 10% drop in TIR greatly raises one\u2019s risk of eye and kidney disease complications, while those with a TIR greater than 80% spend less time in ICUs3,4.Prof. Ramzi Ajjan, Professor of Metabolic Medicine/Consultant in Diabetes and Endocrinology, University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said, \u201cPeople with diabetes navigate not only fluctuating glucose levels, but also the risk of developing other comorbidities like heart disease, obesity, and eye problems. Diabetes and obesity often coexist and together are associated with heart disease risk5,6. CGM can help people keep their glucose levels under control and avoid such risks. For example, people with type 2 diabetes who had experienced a recent heart attack and were using a CGM device reported significantly lowered hypoglycemia levels as compared to those using traditional self-monitoring blood glucose7. Avoiding hypoglycemia can help this high-risk population carry on with their everyday lives.\u201d CGM can help those who may require surgery for their heart disease by optimising their glucose levels before surgery. This potentially can improve their outcomes post-surgery. Such devices meaningfully improve people\u2019s HbA1c levels, slightly increase the time they spend in the optimal glucose range, and enhance their quality of life. These benefits are important, especially as people with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than others8. Additionally, nearly 30% of people with type 2 diabetes had three or more comorbidities at diagnosis9.Prof Shashank R Joshi, President Indian Academy of Diabetes Consultant Endocrinologist Lilavati Hospital and Joshi Clinic, said, \u201cIn the State, there are around 17.8% of people living with diabetes. It\u2019s important for them to maintain glycemic control, which can be made simpler with tools like CGM that help them regularly check their glucose levels. This can help people understand how their food and lifestyle affect their blood sugar. People can accordingly alter their habits and even treatment appropriately, in consultation with their doctor. As a result, they can stay in the optimal glucose range for about 17 hours daily. These connected technologies, with their linked mobile apps, can extend healthcare beyond our clinics, reaching people in their homes.\u201d While the diabetes journey can be difficult to navigate, technology is poised to be a game-changer for diabetes care, taking personalised healthcare a step forward so that people have fewer barriers to good health.

In our bid to distinguish the enhancements of the EWB variant compared to the standard Bentayga, we recently tested this super luxury SUV, available at a starting price of Rs 6 crore, ex-showroom, before considering customisation options.Now in case you're thinking this is just another car with a longer wheelbase, you couldn't be more wrong because in addition to the 180 mm of extension that it gets in terms of wheelbase, it features a lot more. Of course, the extended wheelbase does result in a massive rear door, which clearly outsizes the one available on its standard counterpart. However, there\u2019s more to the EWB in terms of interior and even in the drive experience. As a matter of fact, the Bentayga EWB weighs almost 100 kgs more than the standard version of the model, suggesting an extensive list of changes.Stepping into this luxurious vehicle, you are welcomed by a cabin that exudes sheer excellence. The layout of the interior is not just functional but showcases exceptional craftsmanship at its finest. For all those who are familiar with the standard Bentayga cabin, it's not radically different but yes there are subtle changes you can see in the inlays, the stitching pattern, and even the ambient lighting. Overall, it's a fantastic looking cabin with the wood finish inserts, the traditional clock, which of course you would expect in a Bentley. Most importantly, everything just feels so rich and spot on!Speaking of the very obvious change, the extra space that you get due to the longer wheelbase provides exceptional comfort, complemented by tech-laden rear seats. To make it even better, these are bespoke seats, which means that when you're ordering the car, you can choose for a bench, two individual seats and even Airline-esque seats. Furthermore, you get two connected screens for the rear passengers along with a small touch screen centre console that can be used to operate various functionalities such as climate control, blind-operations for the windows, motorized doors and much more. Bentley has thought about everything no matter what kind of mood you want to be in.Coming to the driving experience of the Bentayga EWB, as far as the powertrain is concerned, nothing has changed. In fact with the standard version, you can get more options but with the EWB variant, you only get the 4-litre, twin turbo V8 petrol engine which develops an impressive 542 hp and 770 Nm of torque. It is mated to an automatic transmission and being an SUV it also gets offroad capabilities. Using the air suspension, you can lower the ride or get it to go higher if you\u2019re driving on tricky off-road terrain. The biggest change in terms of driving is the inclusion of the rear axle steering which now comes as a standard equipment. When you turn, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction and that means the agility or the ability of the car to go through a corner is far better, despite this car being longer than the standard Bentayga because of the rear axle steering. It actually turns in a shorter radius than the standard model and also helps agility through corners.The engine is butter-smooth and when you drive it in the Comfort mode, you're sitting in an absolutely silent cabin so all you get to hear is the tyre roll. Even the aerodynamics are so nicely done that there is hardly any wind noise coming from the outside.Bentley Bentayga EWB Review: Longer but better? | TOI AutoThe gearbox does a brilliant job of masking any lag that might be coming out of those twin turbos and the engineers have worked around this thing so well that when you push the pedal to the metal, it drives quicker than one would imagine looking at its sheer size. Also, in the Bentley mode, it just glides over surface undulations and even when you're at the back you barely feel anything. The suspension does a brilliant job of ironing out all the surface undulations, even the nasty speed breakers.Coming to the prices, like mentioned before, this model retails at a starting price of Rs 6 crore, ex-showroom, before the customisation options kick in. At this price, it is very expensive and not many people will even dream of buying this car in their lifetime but for those select few who can buy this machine, we think they will be happy with their decision for a long time.", "Bollywood's rising starlet Suhana Khan continues to captivate her fans with her impeccable fashion sense, recently embracing the essence of summer in a stunning floral dress.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the quake had a magnitude of 7.4, with its epicenter 18 kilometres (11 miles) south of Taiwan's Hualien City at a depth of 34.8 km.\"Evacuate!\" said a banner on Japanese national broadcaster NHK, reports have quoted.\"Tsunami is coming. Please evacuate immediately,\" an anchor on NHK said. \"Do not stop. Do not go back.\"This is said to be the strongest earthquake in Taiwan in the last 25 years. Taiwan, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, is highly prone to earthquakes due to the collision of tectonic plates. The island experiences frequent seismic activity, with both minor tremors and major earthquakes occurring periodically. In 2018, an earthquake of magnitude 6.2 quake hit near Hualien, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than 300 others. The devastating 1999 Jiji earthquake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, claimed thousands of lives and caused extensive damage to infrastructure. Since then, Taiwan has implemented rigorous building codes and disaster preparedness measures to mitigate the impact of earthquakes. Despite these efforts, the threat of seismic events remains a significant concern, highlighting the ongoing need for vigilance and resilience in the face of natural hazards.Tsunamis are primarily triggered by underwater disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. When an earthquake occurs beneath the ocean floor, it can displace large volumes of water, creating powerful waves that propagate across the ocean's surface. The magnitude and depth of the earthquake determine the size and intensity of the resulting tsunami. Similarly, volcanic eruptions or landslides occurring near or under the ocean can also displace water and generate tsunami waves. As these waves approach shallow coastal areas, they increase in height and speed, posing significant threats to coastal communities and infrastructure. Early warning systems and preparedness efforts are crucial for mitigating tsunami-related disasters.", "Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born in 1630, in Shivner, Poona was a visionary leader who forged the Maratha Empire in the heart of India. Renowned for his military acumen, he utilized innovative guerrilla tactics to challenge the dominance of the powerful Mughal Empire. Shivaji's brilliance lay not only in warfare but also in administration. He instituted effective governance, implementing reforms in revenue collection, establishing a spy network, and organizing a disciplined military structure.In 1674, he was formally crowned as the 'Chhatrapati' or emperor. Shivaji passed away on April 3, 1680, at the age of 50. He breathed his last at Raigad Fort, Mahad.Beyond his military and administrative prowess, Shivaji Maharaj was characterized by his religious tolerance. He respected and protected all faiths within his empire, fostering a climate of harmony and inclusivity. His strategic insight extended to naval affairs, as he recognized the significance of maritime power and built a formidable navy to safeguard coastal territories.Shivaji Maharaj's legacy endures through his prolific construction of forts, strategically positioned across Maharashtra, which served as bastions of Maratha strength. His quotes resonate with timeless wisdom, reflecting principles of valor, governance, and national pride. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's indomitable spirit, courage, and commitment to his people continue to inspire generations, cementing his place as one of India's greatest leaders and a symbol of resistance against oppression.Here are a few facts and quotes from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to know:Despite being known as a warrior king, Shivaji Maharaj received a diverse education. He was well-versed in various subjects including Sanskrit, Persian, and the Quran. His education instilled in him a deep understanding of different cultures and religions, which influenced his policies of religious tolerance later in life.Shivaji Maharaj is often recognized for his military innovations on land, but he also made significant contributions to naval warfare. He pioneered the use of Maratha naval forces, which were equipped with a variety of innovative tactics and technologies, including the use of fire ships and cannons mounted on smaller vessels.While Shivaji Maharaj is celebrated for his military conquests, he also displayed astute political diplomacy. He formed strategic alliances with various regional powers, including the Siddis of Janjira and the Portuguese, to strengthen his position against the Mughal Empire and other adversaries.Shivaji Maharaj was not only a warrior and statesman but also an environmentalist of his time. He initiated several water conservation projects, including the construction of reservoirs, dams, and canals, to address water scarcity issues and ensure agricultural prosperity in his kingdom.In an era where women's rights were often neglected, Shivaji Maharaj displayed remarkable respect for women. He promoted gender equality within his administration and encouraged the participation of women in various aspects of governance, reflecting his progressive outlook on social issues.Quotes by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj:\"Even if there were a sword in the hands of everyone, it is willpower that establishes a government\"\"When you are enthusiastic, the mountain also looks like a clay pile.\"\"Of all the rights of women, the greatest is to be a Mother.\"\"With a single pointed devotion to achieving his aim, a man can attain success.\"\"Everyone should get education.

He sees the young fast bowler as a \"potential pick\" for India's squad in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Hailing from Delhi and aged just 21, Mayank Yadav has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed with each match he plays.His recent thunderbolt clocked at 156.7 kmph against Royal Challengers Bangalore exemplifies his rapid progress. This performance marked his second consecutive man-of-the-match display in his debut season, steering Lucknow Super Giants to a resounding victory.Rabada himself experienced Mayank's ferocity firsthand when Punjab Kings faced Lucknow Super Giants last week. Mayank's barrage of short-pitched deliveries proved formidable as he claimed three wickets with his blistering pace. Rabada, widely regarded as one of the premier pacers in the sport, also commended Mayank's remarkable accuracy.\"He has got something that you cannot buy and that is raw pace. That is exactly what he is exploiting and exploiting it extremely well,\" Rabada told PTI in an interview.\"The lengths that he hits, his plan is clear and now batters are going to be aware of what he can bring to the party but it is pretty obvious he has got immense pace and it seems he can control where he wants to bowl.\"When you have got pace and control as well, and he understands his role.

The rest is up to the coach and management.\"Leading up to the World Cup, if picked, it is something that I would love to be involved in. The IPL would definitely be a test to see where you are at and and see where you can be a bit better and brush up. At the same time, it is about trying to win games for the Punjab Kings.\"Rabada's hunger for titles burns brightly, with aspirations of securing both South Africa's elusive ICC trophy and an IPL championship within the next three months. While Delhi Capitals came close to clinching the IPL title in 2020, Rabada remains determined to achieve a trophy double.In contrast to his South African teammate Quinton de Kock's divisive opinion, who touted the IPL as the pinnacle of his career achievements after triumphing with Mumbai Indians, Rabada stops short of such a declaration. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the IPL's unparalleled significance in the realm of franchise cricket, considering it the foremost prize in the global cricketing arena.\"The IPL is the biggest T20 league in the world barring the ICC events. It seems to be a league that is growing from strength to strength, attracting the world's best players\"He (de Kock) is right in saying it...IPL is definitely the best out there.

However, Siddharth delivered a slower delivery that spun away from Kohli, causing him to mistime his shot and be caught by Devdutt Padikkal, thereby giving LSG their first breakthrough and triggering a batting collapse.In a video shared by LSG on X, Langer reminisced about a discussion with the young bowler regarding the dismissal of Virat.\"Never spoke to him before. I saw him bowl an arm ball and I said, 'Hey Sid, you reckon you get Virat out for us'. He goes, 'Yes sir'. And look at what he does, he gets him out,\" said Langer as the dressing room echoed with applause for Siddarth.Siddharth has entered the prestigious group of bowlers who have claimed the iconic Kohli as their maiden IPL wicket.ALSO READ: How to watch IPL in CanadaA total of 10 bowlers, including Ashok Dinda, Ashish Nehra, Albie Morkel, Chetanya Nanda, Doug Bracewell, Jasprit Bumrah, Mitchell McClenaghan, Harpreet Brar, Dewald Brevis, and now Siddharth, have all managed to dismiss Virat for their inaugural IPL wicket.LSG (181 for 5) defeated RCB (153 all out) by 28 runs in Bengaluru on Tuesday. (With ANI inputs)", "Mayank Yadav is not just bowling fast, but his sky-rocketing reputation as an express fast bowler has probably also put him in the fast lane to finding a place in the Indian team, and may be in line for a spot in the T20 World Cup squad as well.In just two career Indian Premier League (IPL) matches, the Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) pacer, who hails from Delhi, has impressed not just by bowling consistently above 150kmph but also hitting the right lengths and line to trouble every batsmen he has bowled to. The latest of his exploits came in LSG's match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Tuesday, where the right-arm speedster took three wickets (3/14) to dismantle the RCB top order, leading to LSG's victory over the home side at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.According to former Australian allrounder Tom Moody, Mayank is being discussed as a potential candidate for the coming T20 World Cup, scheduled to take place in West Indies and USA from June 1 onwards.\"He is definitely in the conversation. Whether you take that risk punting on him or not is another conversation because you also need to consider what skillset you need in that reserve fast bowler - is it someone who is a powerplay bowler, or someone who has the ability to bowl at the death? All those subtle skillsets are important when you are talking about a T20 World Cup,\" Moody told ESPNcricinfo.Mitchell McClenaghan, former New Zealand pace bowler, also remarked that if Mayank maintains his current form, he will surely be considered for selection.\"If his form continues throughout this tournament, the World Cup starts six days after the IPL, I think it would be crazy not to look at the players who are in form going into that tournament,\" McClenaghan said.\"He may not have the caps behind him, but if he continues this vein of form and can keep his pace up throughout the whole tournament and keep winning games - he has won two games in a row, his first two games - then you are right in the mix. Long shot, but you would not say never,\" he added.At the age of 21, the LSG seamer made history by becoming the first bowler in IPL history to win the 'Player of the Match' award in their first two matches. Clocking 156.7 kmph against RCB, he delivered the fastest ball of the current season and the fourth fastest in IPL history, surpassing his own record set during his debut match against Punjab Kings, where he clocked 155.8 kmph while taking 3/27 in four overs.Mayank's potential as the next prominent Indian pace prospect is not solely attributed to his pace but also to his control over line and length, as well as his ability to intimidate opponents, demonstrated within just a couple of matches.(With ANI inputs)", "NEW DELHI: Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden has shared valuable insights on how teams can effectively counter the remarkable pace of Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) rising star, Mayank Yadav. Hayden suggests that batsmen facing such an intense pace should focus on allowing the ball to come to them rather than trying to force shots off either foot.Hayden's remarks come in the wake of Mayank's impressive performance in LSG's recent victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), where the young fast bowler showcased his extraordinary talent, clocking a speed of 156.7 kmph, the fastest delivery of the IPL 2024 season so far.\"One of the things that happens in this competition is that all eyeballs, all those great players watching him, they are working out strategies of how they are going to play him,\" Hayden commented during the Star Sports Cricket Live show. \"If you bang it on length and the pace is fast, it's tough to hit. And the way you've to play someone of that pace is that you need to allow the ball to come to you. Don't try to force it off the front foot or back foot. Just absorb the pressure and the ball will do the rest because (of) the pace of the delivery.\"Adding to Hayden's perspective, another Australian cricketer, Smith, emphasized the need for batsmen to exploit Mayank's pace to their advantage, suggesting that using the pace effectively could force the bowler to adopt alternative strategies.\"I don't think he bowled a slower ball. They should be using the pace as much as he can to score behind the wicket and make him do something different,\" said Smith. \"He's bowling quick and if you get some bat on it particularly in the Chinnaswamy the ball races away. So try and use his pace a little bit more instead of finding it. Teams are finding it at the moment and they are coming well short.\"Praising Mayank's consistency and impactful performance against RCB, Smith highlighted the young bowler's ability to maintain high standards consistently, which often eludes many players after a standout game.Also Read: How to watch IPL 2024 live in USA, Canada and MENA region\"The thing that impressed me is that he's played his debut game the other day obviously, there'll be a lot of hype around him and you see a lot of players have that one good game and then just can't back it up,\" Smith remarked. \"But he's come straight back in, bowled like an absolute genius, got out Glenn Maxwell one of the best T20 batters in the world, Cameron Green, an international player who plays fast bowling really well and Patidar as well. So three quality players. So Mayank Yadav, remember the name.\"IPL POINTS TABLE | IPL SCHEDULEWith Mayank's stellar performance contributing significantly to LSG's success, the team currently holds the fourth spot on the points table with two wins and a loss from three games. They will now prepare for their upcoming home game against Gujarat Titans at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on April 7 under the leadership of KL Rahul.(Inputs from IANS)", "\"If there\u2019s one thing you should know about this team, we never give up. We\u2019ll keep fighting, we\u2019ll keep going,\u201d Mumbai Indians captain and India allrounder Hardik Pandya posted on X, a day after his team\u2019s six-wicket loss to Rajasthan Royals in front of a hostile Wankhede crowd on Monday.The way things have transpired after the MI team management chose to bring the allrounder back to his alma mater from Gujarat Titans and crowned him as captain, relieving Rohit Sharma, the choice of words could have been better than the ironic \u201cwe\u2019ll keep fighting.\u201dApart from turning around a wretched campaign so far that has seen MI lose three games out of three, Hardik will need to have the Wankhede crowd by his side.The crowd has often acted as MI\u2019s 12th man and the energy it provided has helped them turn around seemingly lost causes. MI now have three more home games, starting Sunday (vs DC), vs RCB (April 11) and CSK (April 14) and if they can win all three, a play-off spot may still be possible. But for that to happen, Hardik will have to reach out to his ex-captain Rohit. One did not see too much interaction between the two on the field in the three games that we have witnessed thus far. The management, bowling coach Lasith Malinga, batting coach Kieron Pollard and head coach Mark Boucher can also play a part in pulling everyone together.If the crowd sees more engagement between the former and current captain, may be the hostility would reduce. Optics is everything. Rohit too has a role to play here. Instead of appearing disappointed, a smile or a hug for his new captain could do wonders.ALSO READ: How to watch IPL in USATactically too Hardik and the thinktank need to get smarter. Not bowling on a fresh wicket, which offered help vs Royals, is a mystery, especially when he has chosen to bowl on flatter surfaces ahead of Jasprit Bumrah.

Why Piyush Chawla was used as a nightwatchman in T20 cricket for Tim David?For a brief while, on Monday, when Hardik counter-attacked during his innings of 34 (27 balls), the boos from the crowd turned into cheers. That was indicative of what they demand. Results. Nothing else matters.", "Fast bowlers are frequently advised to sacrifice speed in favour of developing a wider range of variations. However, Mayank Yadav received invaluable counsel from his esteemed Delhi senior, Ishant Sharma, right from the outset: never compromise on pace to hone other skills.Having already delivered the fastest ball of this IPL season at 156.7 kmph against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), India's emerging pace sensation shared insights during his conversation with 'Jio Cinema'.He reflected on the guidance imparted by Ishant, a seasoned campaigner with over 100 Tests under his belt, as well as another senior pacer, Navdeep Saini.\"All the bowlers I spoke to in Delhi, Ishant bhai and Saini bhai, they all told me that even if I wanted to try anything new, I should play around my speed. If I want to add a new skill, it should be around my speed and that I don't need to add any skills that could compromise my speed,\" said Mayank.While the primary goal remains taking as many wickets as possible to contribute to a victorious outcome, the underlying intention to generate pace with each delivery is first for Mayank.\"My attention isn't on speed as much as it is on taking wickets and contributing to the team by taking wickets. However, it's always in the back of my mind that when I am bowling deliveries, I need to put pace behind them.\"After a match, I always ask people what the highest speed was but during the match, I am only focused on my bowling.\"Yadav's performances have garnered considerable acclaim thus far, with the most recent accolade coming from his outstanding 3/14 display against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Tuesday night.(With PTI inputs)", "NEW DELHI: Following Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) emphatic win against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), star batter Quinton De Kock praised the remarkable pace of Mayank Yadav, hailing his performance as a game-changer in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 season.LSG delivered a commanding performance at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Tuesday, securing a thumping 28-run victory over RCB.Mayank Yadav's searing pace left the opposition batting lineup in disarray, propelling LSG to their second consecutive win in the tournament.The Delhi tearaway showcased his prowess by becoming the sixth bowler in IPL history to claim three-wicket hauls in two consecutive matches. Clocking an astounding speed of 156.7 kph, Yadav unleashed the fastest delivery of the ongoing season, ranking as the fourth fastest in the history of the IPL.De Kock, the South African wicketkeeper-batter, lauded Yadav's simplicity and effectiveness, acknowledging his pivotal role in LSG's success. Speaking in the post-match presentation, De Kock said, \"He (Mayank) is bowling rockets in our team.

This method, known as optical projection, employs optics such as lenses and/or mirrors.Sun FunnelWith this method, we project an image of the Sun from the telescope onto a card or screen. This eliminates the need for anyone to look through the telescope, thereby avoiding refocusing and accidental bumping. Additionally, multiple people can simultaneously view the solar image.Sunspotter and SolarscopeSunspotter employs optical projection to create an enlarged image of the Sun, allowing multiple individuals to view it simultaneously without the need to gaze directly into a bright sunlight beam.An alternative approach is the Solarscope, available in various versions, including some crafted from wood, akin to the Sunspotter, and others made from cardboard.Mirror MethodAnother method involves using a household mirror. By covering a small mirror with a piece of paper or card containing a hole, it's possible to project a pinhole image of the eclipse onto a distant wall.This straightforward technique stands as one of the finest methods for observing the eclipse's progression.Solar ViewerSolar viewers, also referred to as solar viewing glasses or solar eclipse glasses, are specialised eyewear crafted for safe direct observation of the Sun. Unlike standard sunglasses, they are specifically designed to filter out harmful radiation that could damage the eyes.Solar Filter GogglesSolar filter goggles, designed for observing the sun, are usually around 100,000 times darker.Solar FilterSolar filters are designed to block out the majority of sunlight to prevent any harm to the eyes.Welder\u2019s GlassWelder's glass enables direct viewing of an eclipse and is known for its greater durability compared to commercial eclipse glasses.Cautions While Viewing a Solar EclipseRefrain from observing the Sun directly with the naked eye or through optical instruments like binoculars or telescopes.Avoid looking directly at the Sun through the pinhole; focus only on the image projected onto the paper.Do not rely on sunglasses, polaroid filters, smoked glass, exposed colour film, X-ray film, or photographic neutral-density filters for viewing the Sun.Keep your hand or any flammable objects away from the eyepiece to prevent potential burns or fire accidents caused by concentrated sunlight.(Reference: https://www.indiascienceandtechnology.gov.in/sites/all/themes/vigyan/images/ase/Solar%20Eclipse%20Viewing%20mathods.pdf)", "NEW DELHI: Elon Musk CEO of Tesla and owner of X (previously known as Twitter) expressed his intent to purchase shares of Disney (DIS) if activist investor Nelson Peltz secures a seat on the media and entertainment giant\u2019s board.

He would help reform the company, improve the quality of product and generally serve in the best interests of shareholders, as he has done at many other companies,\" Musk conveyed via X platform.He further added, \"This would significantly improve Disney\u2019s share price.\"Musk's remarks were prompted by a post from American hedge fund manager Bill Ackman on X, expressing concerns over alleged leaks to the media about Disney's proxy contest results against Nelson Peltz. Ackman emphasised the inappropriate nature of such actions, stating they could unfairly influence the voting outcome. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Disney has garnered adequate shareholder support to overcome a board challenge from Peltz's Trian Fund Management. The vote count allegedly showed Disney's board members maintaining a comfortable lead over Trian's nominees, including Peltz himself and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.In response to the circulating rumors, Ackman urged DIS shareholders to cast their votes in favor of Peltz\u2019s election to the board. He cautioned against potential manipulation of shareholder behavior through early election result leaks, which could favor the incumbent board. \"Based on my knowledge of Nelson's capabilities and the dirty tricks implemented by the company and its advisors, I strongly recommend that shareholders vote for Nelson Peltz for the Disney board,\" Ackman asserted.Musk highlighted that Peltz's election to the board would make Disney stock more attractive for investment. \"While I don\u2019t own any Disney shares today, I would definitely buy their shares if Nelson were elected to the board.

Russian officials, led by President Vladimir Putin, have continuously alleged, without presenting concrete evidence, that Ukraine orchestrated the attack. Ukraine, embroiled in a conflict with Russia for over two years, has consistently denied any involvement in the incident. Though an affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility and Kyiv consistently denied it.At a meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, of security councils from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), security council head Nikolai Patrushev said, \"\"They are trying to impose on us that the terrorist act was committed not by the Kyiv regime, but by supporters of radical Islamic ideology, perhaps members of the Afghan branch of IS.\" SCO is an economic bloc that includes China, India and Iran. \"However, it is much more important to quickly establish who is the customer and sponsor of this monstrous crime. Its traces lead to the Ukrainian special services. But everyone knows that the Kyiv regime is not independent and is completely controlled by the United States,\" Patrushev added.Following the attack, four suspected gunmen were apprehended in the Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine, with allegations suggesting they were attempting to flee into Ukraine and Six other suspected accomplices have also been arrested.The attack came two weeks after the United States Embassy in Russia had issued a warning about possible terrorist threats on public places, sharing this information with Russian authorities. . The US State Department confirmed sharing information with Russian authorities beforehand.However, Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday declined to comment on reports linking US officials to the targeting of Crocus City Hall in a conference call on a report in the Washington Post that US officials had specifically identified Crocus City Hall as a potential target, saying that was a matter for security services.(With inputs from agencies) ", "CBSE Exam Day Guidelines 2024: The Central Board of Secondary Education is set to commence the CBSE Board Exams 2024 from tomorrow, February 15 onwards.

Researchers are increasingly discovering links between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system that can revolutionise medicine. The gut may not be capable of thought but it does have a great influence on the way we think, researchers have found. The discovery of the close links between gut and brain and body health has revolutionised medicine and helped understand human bodies better.The often repeated phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are what you eat\u00e2\u0080\u009d is proving to be rather intuitive. The fresh understanding of the gut-brain connection has helped doctors diagnose symptoms of diseases that may arise in the gastrointestinal tract but impact mental health significantly. The gut essentially has a \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond brain\u00e2\u0080\u009d that does not participate in intellectual activities but triggers mood changes that can profoundly impact our thoughts. This \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond brain\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the enteric nervous system (ENS) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it consists of two thin layers of 100 million nerve cells lining the digestive tract from the oesophagus (food pipe) to the rectum. The ENS is responsible for digestion as it controls everything from swallowing, the release of enzymes to the breakdown of food and the absorption of nutrients. Scientists has already found that depression and anxiety cause chronic problems like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional gastrointestinal problems like diarrhoea, constipation, bloating etc. However, evidence is emerging that it works the other way round too.With this new knowledge, healthcare providers can diagnose and treat diseases that arise due to the communication pathway between ENS and the central nervous system (CNS). For example, gastroenterologists may prescribe antidepressants to certain patients of IBS to calm symptoms of depression in some cases by acting on nerve cells in the gut. Various other connections between gut and brain health are emerging though they need to be firmly established. It appears that digestive system activity can impact our thinking skills and memory too. Researchers are also studying the way that signals from the gastrointestinal tract can affect metabolism and as a result our propensity toward diseases like Type 2 diabetes. The gut is a rather thriving environment. It is home to gut microbiota \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the microorganisms (bacteria) that aid digestion. These good bacteria keep all processes running smoothly and so, when we talk of gut health, we also talk of nutrients that can keep these bacteria in their fittest form. It is important to have a high fibre diet and cut down on sugars and saturated fats to keep the gut healthy. Alcohol and stress could also disrupt this fragile environment leading to inflammation and a condition that is known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cleaky gut\u00e2\u0080\u009d.The thin lining of the gut controls what gets absorbed into the bloodstream but when this barrier develops \u00e2\u0080\u009choles\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ccracks\u00e2\u0080\u009d due to a bad diet or lifestyle habits, it can pass partially digested food and toxins into the tissues beneath/surrounding it. This may cause changes in the gut flora and cause many chronic diseases. The leaky gut or an increased intestinal permeability may play a role in certain gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Now, research is trying to uncover whether a leaky gut may also contribute to diseases elsewhere in the body. Scientists are exploring links between the gut and autoimmune diseases like lupus, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, allergies, asthma, acne, obesity, and even mental illness.It is clear that when we make alterations to our diet and lifestyle to incorporate food and habits that support overall health, every unit in our body benefits whether it be the gut, brain or heart. It is therefore important to pick a few achievable health targets and be consistent in trying to meet your goals. Exercise regularly to keep stress at bay. Eat a diverse range of food \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fermented products, prebiotic and probiotics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to promote gut health. If these interventions are not enough, then consult your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis of your individual concern. Also, exercise regularly and eat a healthy and balanced diet.(Article Courtesy: Deepak Pal, sports and functional nutritionist, SENS Clinic)Understanding the Intricate Link between PCOS and Sleep Apnea", "An optical illusion is a mind-bending, intensely captivating, shape-shifting image of people, objects, or artwork that defies the brain's normal perception of reality. You have probably witnessed a wide variety of optical illusions, including cognitive, physiological, and physical illusions. According to studies, visual illusions are another area of psychoanalysis that sheds information on perception.A typical human brain is capable of viewing objects or images from several perspectives, creating a unique perception for each. One such ingenious depiction is the picture of the monkey that is hidden someplace within the zoo.A picture puzzle featuring the image above has been posted for both adults and children. We can see a large zoo in this illusion, and a monkey is hiding there. The trick asks spectators to locate the monkey that is concealed within the image. Only one percent of people are said to be able to identify the concealed monkey in this picture. This is just another entertaining way to test your IQ: an optical illusion image. On the other hand, determining your IQ level is best done through an actual IQ test.Can you find the hidden monkey in 8 seconds?We can assist you if you are having trouble locating the hidden monkey. You may make out the giraffes within the zoo if you closely examine the picture. Photographing the giraffes in the zoo is a man. The sight of the giraffes astounds the mom and the children. The giraffe is being fed some plants by the youngster. Your ability to see could be shown by this optical illusion of a zoo. Solution for optical illusion:For your convenience, we have highlighted the zoo's hidden monkey in the picture below. On the left side of the image, the monkey is concealed by yellow foliage. Thousands of adults have been scratching their brains over the photograph, trying to find the hidden monkey.Research indicates that an increased level of difficulty in solving complex riddles makes one generally smarter. Optical illusions consistently provide intriguing insights into the functioning of the human brain. Certain arrangements of color, light, and pattern can cause our visual perception of something to be deceived.

Advocating for awareness and acceptance of ASD stands as a beacon of inclusivity and understanding in our collective journey toward a more compassionate world.At the forefront of this advocacy lies the urgent need to dispel misconceptions and stereotypes surrounding ASD through heightened awareness.All too often, individuals with ASD encounter societal barriers fueled by ignorance and misunderstanding. By shedding light on the diverse manifestations of ASD and the nuanced strengths and struggles it encompasses, we can cultivate empathy and support, replacing judgment and exclusion with understanding and inclusion.Elevating awareness serves a dual purpose of facilitating early intervention and support for individuals with ASD and their families. Timely diagnosis paves the way for access to tailored services and therapies that hold the potential to significantly enhance quality of life for those navigating the spectrum. Moreover, heightened awareness empowers individuals with ASD to advocate for themselves, nurturing a sense of self-acceptance and resilience in their interactions with the world.Beyond awareness, the crux of advocacy for ASD lies in fostering acceptance\u00e2\u0080\u0094an acceptance rooted in the celebration of neurodiversity. Acceptance beckons us to acknowledge that differences in cognitive processes, communication styles, and sensory experiences do not equate to deficiencies but rather represent invaluable variations in the human tapestry. It beckons us to craft environments that accommodate diverse needs and honor the unique strengths inherent in every individual, regardless of their place on the spectrum.Central to the ethos of acceptance is the imperative of dismantling stigma and discrimination directed toward individuals with ASD. Rather than viewing autism as a puzzle to be solved or a condition to be remedied, we are called to embrace a paradigm that champions neurodiversity\u00e2\u0080\u0094a paradigm that recognizes the inherent worth and potential of every individual. Whether through advocating for inclusive policies, fostering understanding in educational and professional settings, or simply extending acts of kindness and empathy in our daily interactions, each of us plays a vital role in nurturing a culture of acceptance.Moreover, the promotion of acceptance extends benefits not solely to individuals on the spectrum but reverberates throughout society at large. Many individuals with ASD possess exceptional talents and abilities, ranging from keen attention to detail to unparalleled creativity and analytical prowess. By embracing neurodiversity and fostering inclusive environments, we unlock the full spectrum of human potential, catalyzing innovation, collaboration, and societal cohesion.The advocacy for Autism Spectrum Disorder necessitates a dual commitment to awareness and acceptance. By amplifying awareness, we dismantle myths, facilitate early intervention, and empower self-advocacy. Simultaneously, by nurturing acceptance, we cultivate inclusivity, challenge stigma, and celebrate the rich diversity of the human experience. Through these concerted efforts, we forge a path toward a more equitable and compassionate society\u00e2\u0080\u0094one where individuals with ASD are not only embraced but empowered to thrive and contribute their unique gifts to the world.(Author Credits: Dr. Mazher Ali, Consultant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Psychiatry, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad)Early intervention strategies for kids with autism- How to promote development and social skills", "Rickets is a condition that primarily affects children, characterised by weak or soft bones. Mostly affecting children, rickets is characterised by weak or fragile bones. It results from a lack of one of the nutrients necessary for strong, healthy bone development: vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. This deficiency prevents bones from reducing normally, which results in skeletal abnormalities, growth issues, and muscle weakness.5 signs that your child might be at risk of rickets Delayed Growth: When compared to other kids their age, it describes a slower rate of growth or a failure to reach the anticipated weight and height. The weaker and insufficiently mineralized bones that are characteristic of rickets cause a delay in growth that can damage a child's physical stature as well as the development of their entire skeleton.Bone Pain or Tenderness: This is caused by weakening and inadequately mineralized bones, and it primarily affects the spine, joints, pelvis, and legs. The discomfort is intensified by pressure or physical activity because the bones' structural integrity is impaired.Muscle Weakness: According to Dr. Saurabh Khanna, Lead Consultant - Paediatrics & Neonatology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn patients with rickets, the lower limbs\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the legs\u00e2\u0080\u0094show the greatest degree of muscle weakening. This condition's weakened bone structure is the cause of this weakness. Muscle weakness and dysfunction result from the bones' inability to sustain the surrounding muscles sufficiently due to inadequate mineralization.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDeformities: Bone abnormalities including knock knees, bowed legs, or an unnaturally curved spine (scoliosis) can result from rickets. These deformities can become more apparent as they develop.Delayed tooth Development: Teeth that are primary (baby) may not erupt as quickly in children who have rickets. Problems in the regular processes of growth and development, such as the mineralization of tooth buds and their subsequent eruption through the gums, are the cause of this delay.Tips to keep your child safe from rickets1 Make Sure Your Child Gets Enough Sunlight Exposure: Let your kids spend time outside, but make sure they're protected from too much sun exposure to avoid sunburns. 2. Provide foods high in vitamin D, such as eggs, fortified cereals, dairy products (milk, yogurt), and fatty fish (salmon, mackerel). 3. Provide foods high in calcium since healthy bones depend on it. Add items high in calcium to your child's diet, like dairy, fortified orange juice, tofu, almonds, and leafy greens like spinach and kale.4. Consider giving Vitamin D Supplements, If your child is at high risk of vitamin D deficiency or if they have limited sun exposure due to factors like geographic location or skin pigmentation, consult with a doctor first about vitamin D supplementation and then give your kids the prescribed one.5. Frequent screenings and check-ups for children are of utmost importance, so do make regular appointments for check-ups with your paediatrician. Your child's paediatrician can evaluate their nutritional state and suggest any required treatments for rickets or vitamin deficiency testing.Teaching kids to be brave: Practical advice from Acharya Prashant", "Ill effects of grinding teethBruxism is a repetitive muscular activity of the jaw that is described by clenching, grinding teeth, thrusting and bracing of lower jaw leading to prolonged tooth contact and wearing off of the tooth structure from the resultant friction. Different symptoms such as excessive tooth wear, frequent grinding sounds, intermittent jaw muscle fatigue or pain, and/ or temporal headache, and/ or jaw locking often upon awakening in mornings are often stated by individuals.It can be done during the day or during sleep.Signs of BruxismEach person may experience bruxism in a different way. The following are some typical signs of bruxism:Grinding or Clenching of Teeth: audible clenching or grinding of teeth, frequently detected by a family member or sleep companion.Tooth Sensitivity: As a result of enamel deterioration and dentin exposure, teeth become more sensitive to hot, cold, or sweet foods and drinks.Jaw Pain or Facial Discomfort: Often occurring or chronic stiffness or discomfort in the jaw muscles, especially in the morning.Headaches: Tension headaches that come back and forth frequently, usually from the temples or back of the head, may be brought on by too much tensed jaw muscles.Signs of wear and tear: Teeth that look flattened, chipped, broken, or have uneven surfaces.Jaw Stiffness: The inability to open or close the mouth completely, combined with a locked-jaw feeling.Sleep disturbances: Bruxism can cause sleep patterns to be disturbed, which can result in excessive daytime sleepiness or inexplicable exhaustion.Receding gums: Gum recession is the receding gum line that exposes more of the tooth root, increasing the risk of periodontal disease and perhaps causing tooth sensitivity.How to treat teeth grinding?According to Dr.Vipin Dehane, HOD-Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, Hiranandani Hospital Vashi & Consultant Maxillofacial Surgery, SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim, \u00e2\u0080\u009cManagement of Bruxism is done by various forms of pharmacological, psychological and dental treatments that are usually directed towards tooth/ restoration protection, decrement of bruxism and pain alleviation. Various muscle relaxants, appliances such as Occlusal Splints, Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD); Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), relaxation and stress management are used for treatment.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCandidiasisAnother issue an individual might face is Oral Thrush or Candidiasis, which is a fungal infection of the mouth caused by Candida Albicans. It usually occurs in those who are immunocompromised or on immunosuppressants, or those who have experienced chronic systemic steroid or antibiotic usage, also those with malnutrition, high sugar intake, those under high stress and those with poor oral hygiene and poor denture maintenance. Oral Thrush can appear in the oral cavity as white or erythematous lesions. White lesions develop as hyperplastic lesions or erythematous lesions (atrophic lesions in acute and chronic forms), median rhomboid glossitis, angular cheilitis and linear gingival erythema. Other rare oral types are chronic mucocutaneous, multifocal candidiasis and cheilocandidiasis. They are usually asymptomatic and appear on the tongue, labial and buccal mucosa, gums, hard and soft palate, and throat. A symptomatic patient experiences burning sensation in the mouth, oral bleeding, and changes in taste perception.Diagnosis of Oral Candidiasis is often based on clinical examination, medical history, risk factors and assessment of lesion's response to antifungal treatment. Cultures and sensitivity tests are done if antifungal treatment is nonresponsive. Topical antifungal therapy and oral hygiene measures are the first line of therapy for uncomplicated cases of oral candidiasis and should be simultaneously adopted when systemic treatment is indicated. Systemic antifungal therapy is usually reserved for patients who are resistant or unyielding to topical treatment and those at higher risk of developing systemic infections. Hence, it is important to maintain a healthy balanced lifestyle for overall physical and emotional wellbeing.Impact of stress on lifeMost people belonging to varied strata of life have known to experience some form of negative stimuli or stress at some point of their lives. Stress can be defined as a feeling experienced when a person perceives that the needs placed on them surpass the available resources. Prolonged negative stimuli cause physical and emotional stress responses in the body.Stress is often found to be associated with sudden life changes, hectic work environments, emotional disorders such as Anxiety, Depression; prolonged negative stimuli and various coping habits such as Bruxism, smoking, high alcohol, and coffee consumption; Sleep Apnea Syndrome, Insomnia, respiratory diseases and reduced immunity due to negative feedback mechanism.Doubts in the heart?

But do not worry! Here is a list of 7 tried-and-true methods that will help you regain your energy and peace of mind by reducing stress like magic. These methods, which range from basic breathing exercises to the therapeutic effects of laughter, are simple to use and have a major impact on stress management.Deep breathingOne of the quickest ways to alleviate stress is through deep breathing exercises. By taking slow, deep breaths, you signal to your body to relax, triggering a calming response in your nervous system. Simply find a quiet space, sit or lie down comfortably, and focus on inhaling deeply through your nose, letting your abdomen expand, then exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat this for a few minutes whenever you feel overwhelmed.LaughterThey say laughter is the best medicine, and it's certainly true when it comes to reducing stress. Watching a funny movie, spending time with friends who make you laugh, or even engaging in laughter yoga can all help release endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals, which can counteract the effects of stress hormones.Social circleDon't underestimate the power of human connection in combating stress. Spending quality time with friends and loved ones can provide a sense of belonging and support, helping to buffer against the negative effects of stress. Whether it's a heartfelt conversation or a fun outing, nurturing your social connections can be a powerful antidote to stress.Positive self-talkOur inner dialogue plays a significant role in how we perceive and manage stress. By practicing positive self-talk, you can reframe negative thoughts and cultivate a more optimistic outlook. Instead of dwelling on what could go wrong, focus on what you can control and find solutions to challenges. Affirmations and self-compassion exercises can also help boost resilience in the face of stress.Image: CanvaDrink stress-reducing teaCertain herbal teas, such as chamomile, peppermint, and green tea, have been shown to have calming properties that can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Adding these teas into your daily routine can provide a soothing ritual to unwind and de-stress. Simply steep a bag in hot water, sip mindfully, and feel the tension melt away.Use a diffuserAromatherapy is another effective tool for stress relief, and using a diffuser to disperse calming essential oils can create a tranquil atmosphere in your home or workspace.

The industry is witnessing a revolutionary shift with the growing acceptance of Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), placing software at the heart of vehicle functionality.This evolution enhances safety, comfort, and connectivity features, providing a richer and more personalized driving experience. Unlike hardware functionally defined traditional vehicles, SDVs can be updated over the air (OTA), enabling continuous enhancements and the addition of new functionalities and security measures without needing physical changes. The market for SDVs is expected to reach an impressive USD 210.88 billion by 2032, highlighting the opportunity for OEMs to transform the automotive industry.New Tata Harrier Review: Many flaws gone, vastly improved | TOI AutoThe transition to SDVs offers multiple benefits, including the simplification of vehicle architectures and a reduction in manufacturing costs. These improvements are made possible by optimizing electrical and electronic layouts and adopting High-Performance Computing (HPC) to eliminate outdated wiring and Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This technological leap forward is set to fuel innovation in creating connected, intelligent, self-driving electric vehicles. Furthermore, the introduction of vehicle operating systems and open API interfaces allows manufacturers to unlock new revenue streams through the provision of additional services. SDVs also promise to enhance the driving experience through regular software updates and the use of cloud-based virtual target units (ECU~HPC) for software (function/features) developments and validation tools to speed up the time to market for new vehicle features.The shift towards SDVs transforms the cybersecurity landscape from focusing solely on physical components and basic electronic interfaces to addressing a broader spectrum of digital threats. The complexity of SDVs, potentially comprising over 100 million lines of code, and their integration into the Internet of Things (IoT), exposes them to various cyber threats. These include data breaches, remote hijacking, and vulnerabilities affecting software updates, and vehicle sensors. Open APIs, backend systems as well as customer privacy and connected devices in SDVs also need robust cybersecurity frameworks that cover both their hardware and software aspects. The balancing act between ensuring robust security measures and maintaining user privacy becomes a critical issue that demands thoughtful consideration. This shift necessitates a comprehensive approach to security, focusing on the entire ecosystem, including the vehicle's software, data privacy, and secure communication channels. The scarcity of skilled professionals who can effectively implement and manage cybersecurity measures for SDVs further aggravates these critical challenges.In response, automakers are adopting best practices from the software industry, like DevSecOps and closed-loop security processes, which integrate security at the initial stages of development. The vision of transforming vehicles into \"computers on wheels\" involves deploying real-time software updates to address vulnerabilities swiftly. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are being utilized to predict and prevent security breaches effectively. Continuous monitoring and quick response to security incidents are crucial in protecting both the vehicle and user data from unauthorized access and misuse, ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.Looking ahead, Accenture's estimate that revenue from digitally-enabled services in the automotive sector will rise to US$3.5 trillion by 2040 brings to the fore the importance of SDVs. The journey towards fully realizing the potential of Software Defined Vehicles hinges on successfully navigating the complex landscape of vehicle cybersecurity. It requires a multifaceted strategy that incorporates security within the design, in-depth defence protocols, continuous risk management processes, and a comprehensive cybersecurity management system at the business level. The automotive industry is being redefined by vehicle cybersecurity as it progresses rapidly towards software-defined vehicles that enhance user security and data privacy. This shift will ultimately usher in a new era of automotive excellence and digital intelligence.Disclaimer: Views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the original author and do not represent any of The Times Group or its employees.", "The Telangana Department of School Education has begun the Telangana State Teacher Eligibility Test 2024 (TS TET) registration process on its official website at tstet.cgg.gov.in.

He emphasized on the matter that the public has the right to know how Katchatheevu was given away. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Jaishankar said, \"We know who did this, what we don't know is who hid it...Public has the right to know how Katchatheevu island was given to Sri Lanka, why even the fishing rights of Indian fishermen were also given up in 1976 after giving an assurance to the Parliament that fishing rights of Indians in the 1974 agreement have been safeguarded.\"\"In 1974, India and Sri Lanka concluded an agreement where they drew a maritime boundary, and in drawing the maritime boundary, Katchatheevu was put on the Sri Lankan side of the boundary,\" he added.He further said that India needs to sit with Sri Lankan authorities and find a solution.Highlighting the background of the issue, Jaishankar said, \"In the last 20 years, 6184 Indian fishermen have been detained by Sri Lanka and 1175 Indian fishing vessels have been seized, detained, or apprehended by Sri Lanka. This is the background of the issue that we are discussing.\"Calling it a \"live issue\" and not something that surfaced \"suddenly\", Jaishankar said, \"The then CM of Tamil Nadu has written to me numerous times. And my record shows that to the current CM, I have replied 21 times on this issue. This is not an issue that has suddenly surfaced. This is a live issue.\"\"It is an issue that has been very much debated in parliament and in Tamil Nadu circles. It has been the subject of correspondence between the union government and the state government,\" he added.He also said, \"DMK questions handing over Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka, claims Tamil Nadu govt not consulted; fact is it was kept fully informed.\"Lashing out at Congress & DMK for their attitude towards the issue, he said, \"Congress & DMK have approached this matter as though they have no responsibility for this.\"\"As though the situation is for today's central government to resolve, there is no history to this, this has just happened, they are the people who are taking up the cause; that is the way they would like to project it,\" he added.Earlier in the day, PM Modi cited a Times of India report and slammed DMK on the Katchatheevu island issue, saying the new details emerging on the matter have \"unmasked\" the party's double standards.The development comes a day after the PM came down heavily on the Congress party and the DMK for giving away the Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka during the tenure of the Indira Gandhi government in 1974. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Katchatheevu deal has infuriated people, adding that the Congress can never be trusted.", "ICICI Bank has issued a cautionary advisory to all its customers, urging vigilance against malicious links and files.
